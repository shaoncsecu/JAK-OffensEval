1) Put .tsv files in the training folder if you want to use them in the Training set.

2) Put .tsv file in the dev folder (with gold lables) if you wish to evaluate your model:
	--> change default_dev_file = '...' location in the EN_Train.py file in order to do this change

3) Put .tsv files in the augment folder if you wish to only use these as the Embeddings*.

*** For Embeddings The dafault code considers everything inside Training/Dev and Augment folder.
