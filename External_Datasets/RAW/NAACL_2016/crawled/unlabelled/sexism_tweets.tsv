846361095476523008	@SecretReptoid @doublemaximus Some of the top results for #YookaLaylee are #GamerGate activists talking about refund requests.	325949439

846406604929019906	@Snozell @The_Extrange Interestingly enough, it seems feminists don't try to shut the panel down if it talks BAD about #gamergate XD	2411290603

846302737868308481	What's more disgustin than Josh callin Amy  slut? @Channel7 allowin him to stay on the show for ratings.Allowing is as bad as doing it. #mkr	24085016

Me: Didn't you see Amy &amp; Tyson in the promo for Super Dinner Parties from last night? #mkr	2208688956

846302673829707776	Honesty can't believe that Josh will call Amy a slut at the super dinner parties. He is disgusting and has no respect for women #MKR	709105290

Amazing dish: $50
Fast track to final: $1000
Not having to see Josh for ~10 nights: PRICELESS #MKR	2640990344

846302637217628160	Dear @mykitchenrules: Do you really have to show every single thing Josh says? There are actually interesting people I rather hear from #MKR	1718381660

846302519609339905	Did Josh really just say "thanks slut"?? Because I heard "thanks love". I thought he was a scumbag but that is a whole other level... #MKR	805682311

846302044797353984	The result of tonight's cook off was kinda given away during the controversial add when Josh is a dick to Amy @mykitchenrules #MKR	72549881

846338136825368576	#GamerGate supporters are people &amp; tweets I can't see on the bus &amp; billboard ads freak the hell out of me.	2878943566

846315943131299841	@KotakuInAction Strange how this doesn't merit 30 blogs of "The leader of #GamerGate endorses yooka laylee".	845649349

846301741268185092	Seriously though #MKR needs to review when they play their ads I mean everybody already knew who won, they showed Amy at the dinner parties	326072627

846302094952845313	Does angry angry man put Josh's head through a window? #mkr	257709797

846303631141875713	Who the hell figured out you could eat a sea urchin's tongue? #MKR2017 #mkr	166947850

846302133150367744	The promos gave it away. We've seen for days now that Amy and Tyson are in the super diner parties #MKR	426167499

846302653470556161	What a surprise. Josh is a misogynistic prick #mkr	25247108

846302026598248448	Lol I just realised #MKR basically ruined who won tonight this whole week with their ads	463297578

846302085746479104	Maybe #mkr will even show valerie and courtney speaking ont he episode in which they're cooking instead of josh	347048522

846302167996678145	Amy and Tyson, your dish was literally perfect and completely captured the decedent theme. However, you fell short in marketability.  #mkr	77377229

846286493509332992	If Josh isn't thrown off the show after calling a contestant a slut this week or whenever I may boycott #MKR	2105021

846286740658647041	Josh had that look on his face as if to say "Oh that's how you work as a team" #mkr	808150057

845761579928993792	I have the top comments on a hill and had to get into the #GamerGate shit.	1286859672

846286294246338560	Josh: "With this salmon I would remove all the flesh and the skin, and serve vegetables." #MKR	1695442555

846286309521960960	Did he just say the challenge is for pleb taste buds not Amy &amp; Tyson? #mkr	347048522

846286093322354692	"It would be weird... cooking by yourself" Amy said, dreaming about only ever cooking by herself as Josh floats away on a giant fish. #MKR	151295755

846286068391395328	Guys, I'll have @Calmania and @Toby_Francis to cook as partners in #MKR. I bet they'll cook better than #SeaFoodKing!	2992671032

846286516049502208	Tyson encouraging Amy is kind of sweet. And to think at the beginning I didn't like them! But then we met Josh! #MKR	17633518

846286727937351680	#MKR Della and Tully are a bit like Josh and Amy sadly....one of them has NFI...	61422376

845763112741548036	Why isn't there a game like Watch_Dogs that doesn't construct rape of bi ppl? #gamergate	755083757766447113

846286241410670592	Why is Josh commentating every episode? Who cares what he thinks?! #MKR	161175227

845727755094372352	I wanna show up and trigger everyone at the #GamerGate meetup.	3146913309

846285496842043392	A critical test match, AFL360, Talking Footy, On the Couch, Footy Classified all on &amp; I'm sitting here allowing the missus to have #MKR on?	563390928

846285880985759744	No Amy you haven't cooked as a team with Josh. He's always yelling at you #mkr	808150057

846285687670300674	How frustrating for the teammate who's not involved yet! #MKR	25922151

846285894222938112	I know what would compliment the salmon, THE BIN

846285857833213952	Half of the team should be hidden to what the other half prepares.  That's a challenge!  #mkr	181892978

846285679382323200	Glad to see that the boys can do more than meat! Lol #MKR	21471987

846285571592896512	Ooh the ultimate teamwork challenge! Haven't had a challenge where one person cooks by themselves yet #MKR	709105290

846285896781488129	Amy I thought you'd be used to cooking entire meals by yourself?#joshamy #mkr	1906897608

846285825532837888	Wish the Dinner Party would start already #MKR	3548284519

846285593789161472	Confit salmon and pea purée sounds like baby food. Throw in some texture? #mkr	2269865773

845735573163790338	I just devoured a bun. It was fine. #GamergAte	2793120500

846285454668312576	#MKR we know Tyson and Amy and Court and Duncan  are at the dinner parties - pretty sure the promos also showed the guys and Della 🤔	61422376

845734860593483777	The "that's not REAL Sci Fi crowd" is just as cancerous as the "that's not REAL #GamerGate crowd."	2846136124

846285548637511680	oh, of Course Josh would be able to do The Best dish with these ingredients... Pity he's not good enough to be competing. #MKR	250858116

846285257271783425	#MKR "We can all cook a piece of salmon" You would not be able to say that if Josh was in the cook off!	340376505

846285903542697984	I would've thought Amy would be used to cooking by herself. She does 99.9% of the work.  #mkr	24512970

846285715017162753	If anyone's interested, Josh is on Facebook. Sadly it won't allow you to go to his page. Probably for the best. #MKR	112959280

846285402277261313	#MKR Josh is jealous again.  He can ruin that salmon better than anyone else.	2900969792

846285126820519936	There's a knock on the door at #MKR headquarters.
The door opens.
A stupid challenge walks in.	25012623

846285613649178624	Bummer was hoping they would be split up #MKR	825986856340779008

846285253534670848	On some positive notes (away from Josh), look how gentlemanly are Tim &amp; Kyle? #mkr	24997928

846285709539356672	#mkr You turned the oven on for the confit salmon, right?	162266849

846285823402098688	At least the non cooking partner can sit there and see what's been done.  #mkr	1391963988

845720835142795265	It's so easy, all you have to do is fall in love #gamergate	2837685867

845729203282587648	Play the game #gamergate	2837685867

846285542115422208	And #DellaTully are also through to next round! Their vibrant plate of scallops looked so good! #MKR	801279718049783813

846285258832015360	Mystery box much? They can discuss before switching out! Not hard enough!  #MKR	414418714

846285794994089984	Is there a point of showing this challenge tonight when #MKR spoiled the outcome in its ads? We saw the teams that didnt make it in said ads	898707906

846285089688367104	'We're giving you a box of mysterious ingredients, but I must stress this is NOT a mystery box. We've been advised by our lawyers' #MKR	46076472

846285379443445760	Josh has so many ideas of how to destroy that salmon #mkr	1127209561

846285353791062016	Josh was sooooo sure he would've kicked arse on that salmon. Or just kicked it's arse &amp; ruined it....again. #MKR	714051386

846285287349088256	A salmon based challenge? Oh Josh must be disappointed. Yet another type of fish to ruin. #mkr	3017002076

845723041225228288	I just had a pineapple. It was yummy! #GamergAte	2793120500

846285688102305792	#MKR salmon must be relieved Amy is as bad at plating as Josh is at cooking seafood!	61422376

846285342814617601	Basic regular ingredients, like salmon roe and kale Pete? Or a smidge of bone broth and some activated almonds perhaps? #mkr	18346637

846285797217095680	Tim and kyle are confident .😊  #MKR	779924188568047616

846285730720575489	Jealousy is a curse, Josh. Don't be jealous. Just enjoy watching from the sidelines, which is your best place, other than in the bin. #MKR	78492265

846285253593378816	No, Court. This competition has shown us that not everyone can cook a piece of salmon. #MKR	1695442555

845914769693392897	Scallops look so much better than the bisque so if that's a 3 then the bisque must be a 1 #MKR	2105021

845914365731614720	Josh, why do you speak?  Nothing of any interest ever comes out of your mouth.  #mkr	1391963988

845195506967990272	To contrast this realize that while #GamerGate opposes SJW/anti-gg their opposition is intentional and conscious.	854203626

845189675924914177	you may be shocked to learn that apparently #gamergate  is still a thing?	768934560457306113

845914325411774464	Josh is devastated. 
Never seen him act so concerned like that when he fails cooking seafood though. #MKR	99233470

845194887536394243	@Stoicfnord Obviously #GamerGate will talk about it. We talk about everything that is related to gaming culture wars and media bullshit.	3382121055

845914928468836352	I think the boys have kicked a goal with entree #mkr	295057468

845914389723070464	Did they taste the bisque? #mkr	16646090

845914429971619840	Complaining about char on scallops, conveniently forgets picking off burnt bits from prawns. Pot meet Kettle #MKR	177039045

845198032102576130	@SquidCoyote TLDR: #GamerGate shares head space with anti-GG/SJW's and their very existence as a movement is based on what GG does/says.	193698236

845915126146330625	YAY! Brett and Marie cooked the scallops well!  #MKR	24512970

845195714967695360	Why do they always keep running away? Is ur position that weak that u can't argue about it? Afraid of having ur views challenged? #GamerGate	3382121055

844686769882746880	@MegaMike1983 @El_Scrumpo so what's the deal with this gokunaruto anyway??? Am I being #gamergate harrassed?  Sweet Patreaon £££, YESSSS	3295575222

844492019774861312	Josh is very lucky  not being in the presence of me. Men like that are absolute scum and I would drag him out front and kerb stomp him #mkr	2874675524

844491759992254464	If Josh and Amy do make it to Sudden Death again, I could see them going for sure because of how much they hate Josh #mkr	270351649

844491474423054336	Ugh @Channel7 why would anyone bother watching the sudden death of #MKR Sunday when your promo showed the winning team multiple times?	24338184

844491592836702208	'We work so well when we're not in the same space' - Amy to Josh 😂

It's not called Our Kitchen Rules for a reason haha #MKR	2895981120

844490968116060161	So we get to see the real depths at which shows Josh best and there is not enough character space to describe or call him. He is a grub #mkr	2874675524

844494425715720192	@SueKennedy19 'Post-Josh-douchey-alcoholism', it's a newly classified condition 😂 #mkr	842098038294245376

844678971019018240	All you have to do is fall in love #gamergate	2837685867

844491714106556416	Oh there is no way on EARTH that i am missing next weeks episodes. Cant wait to see Amy walk out on her dick bag husband. #mkr	30202337

844687509678305280	Play the game, play the game of love #gamergate	2837685867

844491601145544704	Look, bagging on Josh for three months is fun and all,  but i actually kind of miss the cooking part of this show occasionally #MKR	94033375

844491459168354304	@SueKennedy19 why? 😂 because there's an extra 2 teams? #mkr	25651622

844490813656641536	God he's repulsive. Josh, eat a bag of dicks. #joshamy #mkr	619118264

844491617213935617	Yup, Josh is a dck!!  #MKR	3062711768

844493214321012737	Kinda want to start a gofundme to fly to Broome and hit Josh in the face with a chair #MKR	352054857

844701877619097601	So Jim (InternetAristocrat) pussied out of #GamerGate because we wouldn't be his personal army.
Yet I'm seeing people suck his dick again...	2607096330

844491017868865537	I'm getting tired of #MKR to be honest.. too much drama, not enough cooking.  You don't gain anything from it anymore. #sorrynotsorry	33894316

844492200192880641	If Amy does walk away from Josh next week they may not even need Sudden Death to be eliminated #mkr	270351649

843757370735906816	In all honestly. Isn't this challenge going against all @mykitchenrules protocols? They're encouraging buying sauce instead of making. #MKR	754565838

843757802703151104	If josh wins Coles can expect a lot of "accidents" resulting in smashed sauce bottles in aisles #MKR	3233038603

843392377502887936	I'm disappointed that none of the teams got into the 'cruise ship' spirit by serving an drink spiked with GHB or Rohypnol #mkr	217028513

843392743309111297	Um Josh....the team to beat in sudden death isn't a good thing. It means you're constantly crap. #MKR	714051386

843392538987831296	That's the point of the competition Josh winning sudden death. #mkr	1245735506

843392237606068224	I'm shocked 😳 #MKR	2105021

843392688837681152	This is the issue with #MKR. The actual great and consistent cooks get eliminated for 1 bad dish. It's a bit of a joke.	414418714

843390638963875840	So I think it's safe to say that the screeching banshee girls knew how to cook four dishes only. After that, they were useless. #MKR	94033375

843390594005180416	I am surprised that everything doesn’t taste like chicken schnitties. That will be pretty much all they cook in the galley. #MKR	2887851457

That's not the other contestants, mate!

Backhanded compliment from Manu. #MKR	3498113114

843390437356322816	Surely now we all now that Josh can't cook anything much, Amy did most of the cooking. #mkr	49939060

843390266937548800	Just eating curry paste doesn't tell you how hot the dish will be. Hope they don't dumb it down #mkr	764065375549988864

843391246601138177	Josh should ask if he could stay as an individual in the competition, if they lose. Amy has let him down way too many times. #mkr	99233470

843385257344741376	Why would you serve Cous Cous with Salmon? Or any other fish, while we're asking? You want something that's moist, even greasy. #MKR	250858116

843386068518895616	@annie_chaplin My sentiments entirely Annie. Hope they leave tonight. #MKR	4872424153

843382505931644929	If cooking doesn't work out for Josh, he should do motivational speaking. Still having confidence after all his fuck ups is admirable. #MKR	3498113114

a) Verb - to tease
b) talk to or treat your partner like crap, whilst being an obviously massive flog in a kitchen #mkr	70990286

843382055870353408	What a great idea, sticking josh onto pot stirring. Hopefully he doesn't stuff that up either.  #MKR	24512970

843382562248519680	Josh cuts off the best part of the salmon. Your not showing the judges you can cook seafood, your showing them once again your a hack. #mkr	1245735506

843381901813415936	You can't multi-task Josh?  #MKR	2105021

843379211427491840	LOL, of all the unbelievable shit #mkr has tried to sell me, Josh successfully cooking that crab is the most ridiculous. To Netflix!	17263897

843379821048606721	That means he’s in Artarmon, I suspect about 6 kilometres from where I think #mkr is filmed, and about 4km from anything good to eat.	16676087

843379462750195712	Jesus, look at Liz Egans hair, can we blame #CarnivalCruises for that. Or, does she have snacks hidden in there?

843378403684245505	Josh is horrible. Amanda is praising josh and Amy's dish and all he is doing is criticising Kelsey and Amanda's #mkr	34472348

843378003677667329	Personally I wouldn't want to be within 100 metres of Josh's crabs, soft shell or not 🤢#MKR	1557009919

843378626905100288	This so called “Sea Food King” needs a fucking hiding for the way he was talking to the girls there. A cunt of the highest order #mkr	636009780

843376656131604480	@mykitchenrules #MKR I seem to remember Josh saying he could cook fish better than a 5 star Chef with his eyes closed. Whattajoke #JoshAmy	2700379730

843377574499631104	Josh can't cook the crabs two at a time because his other hand is busy #wanker #MKR	71416635

843377637758132224	How has Josh's face not been deep fried? #MKR	46076472

843377659119722497	Let's go teams you can do this  #mkr	22906827

843377793962393600	Josh must have gone to the Donald Trump school of respecting women #mkr #nobodyrespectswomenmorethanme #believe me	1127209561

843377499199299585	Aaaaand tonight we're pronouncing 'kewpie' wrong #MKR	189808130

843376793193082881	“Get the crabs out of the way”
“Don’t talk to me like that Josh, this isn’t our bedroom” #MKR	22120918

843377699737362432	It's fair to say Amy is a bit crabby with Josh at the helm #mkr @Channel7	808150057

He's really giving me the shits tonight. #MKR	3007677782

843377600265244672	Really Josh? One crab at a time?  #mkr	162266849

843376424702566400	@GidgitVonLaRue @SueKennedy19 French is so cliche though. ;) #punintended #MKR	701700498034790401

843376606445944832	Josh comes across as the kind of dickhead who trolls women on the Internet. He's terrible. #MKR #JoshAmy	15374531

843377647052771328	Who would've thought soft shell crab would be soft. #mouthbreather teaches me something everyday, like how not to be a fucktard #mkr	2322065402

843376969383211009	Pauline Hanson should train Josh how to cook seafood after her years of being a chippie owner.. She's gotta be less useless than him #mkr	39961296

843376435775463424	@SueKennedy19 I'd starve on #MKR because I hate seafood. 😜😀	4872424153

843376994314215426	Amy telling Josh not to be stupid is about 25 years too late. #MKR	714051386

843377832243871748	Are they actually on a sailing cruise liner or is a cruise liner that's docked somewhere? #MKR	232704551

843377822039072768	Josh's arrogant behaviour towards Amy borders on bullying #mkr	26142201

843377831140769792	Josh would not work well in a commercial kitchen. #mkr	1261842918

843377750048043009	An exciting night in the kitchen! #mkr	236763329

843377619722629120	Wait.. Josh has crabs? 😂😂😂 #MKR	750772255

843377730892648449	"Leave it. Turn it. Leave it" my head is spinning #mkr	599745022

843376333862260736	Look, I know they prompt the contestants to talk us through what they are doing but sometimes it is so ANNOYING!   #mkr	1391963988

843376452342968320	I can't take any cooking tips about seafood from Josh, seriously. #joshisnottheseafoodking #mkr	611806699

843377326096183296	Soft shell crab meant to be crunchy? #MKR	2887851457

843376305714352128	My fantasy wogslaps were previously exclusively politicians. I now nominate Josh for double backhand AND forehand wogslaps. #mkr	898707906

843376693926494208	Josh is certainly putting Broome on the map! No one will want to go there!!  #MKR	21471987

843377701264154624	Josh is about 5 seconds away from Amy throwing that boiling oil all over him. #mkr	291044696

843377666182930434	How can Amy deal with someone like Josh??? He's terrible. #MKR	414418714

843377747590238211	Good to see Josh moving his crabs around #mkr	835640715161919490

843377861432037376	@greysfan on tv! #mkr	599745022

843375482892574720	"This crab is ridiculously soft.." well no, then we'd be calling them 'ridiculously soft-shell crabs' Josh you massive twat #MKR	214783050

843375842856067073	At least the raw onion or disguise the taste of the burnt fish #mkr	98242373

843375461073739777	#MKR I would be pushing Josh overboard..	27813235

843375579999100928	@mykitchenrules #MKR #JoshAmy #KelseyAmanda Go Girls. We all Want Joash to go Home. The more I see, he can't cook and would burn water.	2700379730

843376044388184064	I just want Josh to go home.  Not MY home.  #mkr	21733991

843375494091354112	Josh is in his "Zone". That would be the dickhead zone then? #MKR	714051386

843376010942861314	What does #Amy do when she sees #Josh staggering around the back yard? She reloads.  #mkr	162266849

843375847255891969	Amy kinda sounds like she knows how to cook, but unfortunately she is married to Josh.. Mr Wing It, in the sudden death. #badplan #mkr	30202337

843376141989699584	I haven't had time to get to Wednesday yet. I'm sorry guys. I don't know when I'll have time to :( #MKR	2105021

843375673561427969	@AffekeNommu that's ok then. I was going to blame josh for nearly killing everyone #MKR	24512970

843375611359842304	I bet $20 that Josh and Amy met on the special bus and bonded over their love of window licking. #mkr	46294806

843375840607920129	Putting mango and avocado together? Wow, well that's never been done before. What a masterstroke. #mkr	138294089

843375622457970688	I surprised josh/amy still there cooking 
#mkr	4880602084

843375311676829696	#mkr where did Josh learn his sea food skills.	624297760

843375593672531969	Settle petal, raw red onion is perfectly alright in a salad.  #mkr	162266849

843375625897299968	Anyone secretly want #joshandamy to win just so we can continue to bitch about them? #mkr	39961296

843375573959245824	@GidgitVonLaRue @K_I_Am2U From your last few tweets I'd say you're back in the saddle!! 😱😵😈😂 #mkr @mykitchenrules	154428775

843375918928224256	You should have to prove you can cook a protein before you're allowed to cook with it on #mkr... then Josh would be making a bowl of Weetbix	17263897

843375772828024832	Josh is such an arsehole.... #mkr	131179888

843375336934981633	Those soft shell crabs have been frozen.  Why bother??? #MKR	352723432

843375932958113792	Watching live blows, no ffwd button.. #mkr	12201452

843375420057645056	Amy is angry Josh has crabs .... hey we've all been there! #mkr	4371766332

843375214494855168	Josh seems to be adept at handling his crabs.  #mkr	162266849

843375382808076288	of course josh wants to take over everything the cunt #mkr	90722080

843375635149996032	I just hope Amy has a brain snap in wake of Josh's shit and slams his stupid fucking face into one of those searing hot plates  #mkr	2874675524

843375797620547584	Maybe Josh could try something new and be supportive of his partner 🙄 #mkr	38606231

843375722592784384	has josh been awarded husband of the year yet? #mkr	716520912648937476

843375430677667840	Josh is annoying and this is not fake news ..#mkr	3319646107

843375826045353984	So that's what soft shelled crab is. You learn so much on #MKR	545040423

843373101119283201	#MKR Josh "I haven't given my best yet" You can say that again. You can't even cook a prawn.	340376505

843373064700149760	Come on Kelsey and Amanda. Show Josh and Amy what you're made of. #MKR	831068194689290242

843372529116831745	How many chances does Josh need to see that he is far removed from a  "Seafood King"? #MKR	714051386

843372310077693952	How much fish do they have on this damn cruise ship? #MKR	214783050

843373037311340544	you know josh is gonna bitch at amy if she makes them go home i'm uncomfortable #mkr	90722080

843373073126498304	Josh wants to spend the rest of life at sea. Leave him there. #mkr	1245735506

843372269694935042	how can a seafood lover be this completely inept #mkr	90722080

843372292956602369	You have to give Josh credit for confidence, no matter how undeserved it is #MKR	27387249

843372824181923840	Seeing Josh in chefs whites is an insult to all actual chefs. #MKR	714051386

843373172581851137	Amy calling the shots tonight...So lots of "this is on your head" from Josh tonight?  #MKR	812770716445593600

843372872101904384	Josh shouldn't be allowed to wear chef whites. He hasn't earned that right #MKR	2105021

843373167636754432	Josh: "I've burnt prawns in a galley before, we'll be fine" #MKR	177039045

843373003597471744	Another bittersweet #cookoff i like the #sisters but #joshamy bring so much drama!!! #MKR @mykitchenrules	1381589784

843372911062736897	It's obvious what is happening on #MKR. People loved to hate Josh, but now they just hate him so it's time for @Channel7 to fuck him off.	94033375

843372977991254017	Judges looking spiffy ... hello #mkr	3319646107

843373199505022977	Oh good, Amy's head chef. Now Josh can blame her if they lose #mkr	1127209561

843372838899736576	“We’ve both worked in galleys before. In a past life as Roman slaves” #MKR	22120918

843372514411651072	#MKR At least Josh is confident in his cooking abilities.	27813235

843373202671718401	@mykitchenrules Looking forward to tonight's episode #KelseyAmanda You go girls!  Let's take out the #SeafoodKing 😂#MKR	1899768499

843372610767409152	THAT POOR EXCUSE OF A MAN SHOULD NOT BE WEARING CHEF WHITES. WHAT A FUCKING INSULT #mkr	2874675524

843372785044865024	Getting #StrangerThings vibes from the #MKR background music.	17263897

843372388272111616	Let's see what complete arrogant verbal abuse josh is going to give his partner tonight #mkr	2874675524

843372919254278144	"Josh is a douchebag, we want to gut him like a fish." is the only correct answer to "why do you want to survive?" #MKR	17263897

843372139524775937	Prediction: despite the promo Josh and Amy will stay. Every comp needs its villain #MKR	26125969
