@IshMiester @PiaGlenn #notallmen, right dude? Stop blaming women for men's unwanted, un-asked-for behavior.
@Jarmadillos @united nothing would happen, dumbass. Just like it didn't today. You #feminazi clowns are a constant source of entertainment.

Don't talk to me about #NotAllMen when every woman I've ever met has had the experience of fearing for her safety if she rejects a dude

@LinzDeFranco #notallmen with specific names are idiots. Gosh I haven't thought of that hashtag (and the dumpster fire it is) in a while
If you feel the need to say #NotAllMen, you're part of the problem. Especially if you then go and victim blame women.
@trehan_barkha I believe #ccd itself would be worried of #biasedlaws n probable #fakecases tht can a woman file on them.
