@Dekkles As the hashtag goes - #notallmen but too many
Josh is a douchebag, we want to gut him like a fish. is the only correct answer to "why do you want to survive?" #MKR
Josh is a show bag......
Josh- Can't cook fish
@SalmanSoz Ah that's like saying #NotAllMen It's about majoritarianism. A vast number of our fellow Indians are racist and bigoted.
#MKR Of course they are hungry - bogans wanting free food.
Did he say cumin AND coriander, where's  Madhur Jaffrey when you need her? 
pete: good luck... (whispers) and dont fuck it up
#MKR Josh is like that really annoying kid from my year 3 class, and Amy is my teacher who was constantly annoyed with him.
And sure, #notallmen - BUT HOW CAN YOU KNOW. literally how do you know who you can trust.
#FreedomOfSpeech Twitter full of a box 
Could it be....?
Holy fuck! Josh really is hacking into that poor animal!
Josh is devastated. 
Josh is going to "wing it" -  he can't even master a recipe #mkr
By next season, all contestants will have to wear @Coles sandwich boards whilst they cook. Losers get facial tattoos #mkr
I think he might have cut more evenly if he'd used the rolling pin #hacked #MKR
@LiberInquieto @Manly_Chicken @stillgray @ashelia 
Hay @bioware here's a good idea how about instead of scapegoating a two-year-old hashtag for your games issues, fix them!
I think we have seen your best, Josh, and your best is utter shit. #MKR
I know the earth is flat because I could only exist in a one dimensional universe. FACT.
Amy looks like she's dying on the inside. Because of Court and Duncan or because she's married to the ultimate douche lord?
@MadgunRus
You meant to say #NotAllMen. @twot134x

@streetvoiceuk oh really? Why did he choose 2 come back to live with me then? Stop making things up you #feminazi #twat
Aww don't cry Kelsey, it's just the entree 😢  #MKR
The distinction between a #feminist and  #feminazi would be that the latter tries to turn unrelated topics into a discussion about women.
Again,MEN ARE TRASH is not a collection of personal heartbreak &amp; infidelity stories.Stop trying to make #WomenAreTrash or #NotAllMen a thing
Here they come..
#MKR "Us being sisters helps, because we can interpret the whale sounds that we keep making when we get excited."
As much as Kelsey and Amanda annoy me, I'm cheering them on tonight like I've never cheered before  #MKR
I spot @GleekDownUnder on my screen woohoo!!! #MKR
When they serve the chicken to the judges will court and Duncan ask:
I feel sorry for Amy, she married a douche! 
But men, a lot of men (#notallmen), see that shit as a challenge. And this the games begin.

Even IF every single SJW buys Andromeda
Shud up Josh!
They're playing “Leaving Earth” from the @masseffect 3 score in the opening sequence of #MKR ? That's so intense hype for this cook off
#MKR using the @masseffect 2 in game music? Really? That's some lazy work

It would seem that 'jus' is the flavour of the season.
Amy telling Josh not to be stupid is about 25 years too late. #MKR
@Tyquanah @Chocsburgers #Feminazi its called action and reaction. Cause and effect. Every action has an equal and opposite reaction.
