Before wasting time dredging up the whole ‚Äúseparation of Church and State‚Äù fallacy, consider the words of James Madison, the Father of Our Constitution:  ‚ÄùWe have staked the whole of all our political Institutions upon the capacity of mankind for self-government, upon the capacity of each and all of us to govern ourselves, to control ourselves, to sustain ourselves according to the Ten Commandments of God.‚Äù  The man who authored our Constitution did not leave any room for doubt about governing ourselves according to the Ten Commandments of God.  The Congressional records further Christianity as the established religion of these United States of America:     The process of drafting the First Amendment made the intent of the Founders abundantly clear; for before they approved the final wording, the First Amendment went through nearly a dozen different iterations and extensive discussions.   ‚ÄúWe do not want in America what we had in Great Britain: we don‚Äôt want one denomination running the Nation.  We will not all be Catholics, or Anglicans, or any other single denomination.  We do want God‚Äôs principles, but we don‚Äôt want one denomination running the Nation.‚Äù  This intent was well understood, as evidenced by court rulings after the First Amendment. In 1799 the court declared, ‚ÄúBy our form of government, the Christian religion is the established religion; and all sects and denominations of Christians are placed on the same equal footing.‚Äù   The U.S. Almanac, while a respected publication, does not constitute the ultimate authority.  Our Founding Fathers, speaking through the U.S. Constitution, hold such authority.

The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don't even know the difference between fatwa and appeal.  A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa).  We expect apology from your side for such a mistake",0,1

Unless there are ways to make good this loss, concessions cannot be given. Had demonetization been successful in curbing the black money, the govt. would have had extra revenue to allow concession in personal taxation. Since the concession in this score is nominal, if not negative taking inflation into account, it is written on the face of the Union Budget, 2017 that there is very little success in curbing the black money by demonetization.  On the other hand govt. needed money for several welfare schemes and definite sources to raise this money. Since independence salaried class is the most certain source of tax revenue and thus govt. decided to take it for a ride for another time. The persons who got delighted thinking that the ill gotten  wealth of the dishonest people in their neighbourhood would now be caught, are probably still not aware of it. If they are still delighted by seeing the budget analysis on TV and think that this budget is a great booster for rural and infrastructure sector here is one statistics.

Entrepreneur have been spoiled due to Dubious Actions by Vengeful Officials of corrupted  ISI, SBI, KFC, etc. From 1982 to 1997, they have played with my life as an SSI unit proprietor.  During 1990, I tried justice  from ISI and SBI through Kerala State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission  and in 1992,  an appeal filed with National CDRC, both Commissions having Judicial as well as Non Judicial Officers found some technical reasons to deny me Justice. I had no advocate to sue my plight. All members of both Commissions realized the truth, but with the help of LIMITATION Act. But my inexperience and obligation towards the system, I became silent and continue efforts to revive and rehabilitation of my Sick SSI unit with full cooperation of Industries Department. On 7.7.1995, I paid to KFC on One Time Settlement in full spirit of letter  of KFC dated 23.6.95. But my inability to please the corrupted Officials, the unit taken over by Revenue Recovery Act on 30.5.95 was kept with custody of KFC. I was at  Head Office of  KFC, Trivandrum  after my OTS payment, till a road accident at Palauan over Trivandrum on 6.3.97.  I was under treatment from Medical College  Trivandrum, Kannur District Hospital, City Hospital Mangalore, etc and in least of 1997, I visited KFC  HO with the help Crutches, and realised that instead of blood, water is flowing through the Officials and the same day visit Kerala State CDRC and very next day filed a complaint against KFC. After three months, the Commission received reply from KFC with copy to me. On the basis of KFC's reply, the Commission started dictating Judgement and Dismissed my Complaint directing to Sue in Civil Court. Next day I filed a Review Petition besides few other. The Hearing Day when I stand with help of Crutches and started to express my view, the Commission President threatened on huge cost to be Ordered against me. I managed to escape the so called Consumer Court with fear.  But still I know that any one have common sense will award justice to me from National and State CDRC on both cases.  After ,1977 to 2009, I was under acute mental depression. I started writing to Central And State Governments and hence passed 5 pages G O, in 2010 direct KFC to settle issues at Board Level and to write to various Ministries of Government of India to enquire and compensated me due to Dubious Actions by ISI and SBI.  But my efforts continue yet, the Corrupted Officials also continue to resist my efforts at my 67th age.  What we understand from the synopsis of plight-  Officials have good salary and support from all cadre of Government to save corrupted ones with the backing of so called Provision in court both Judicial and Quasi Judicial, like CDRCs, Human Rights Commissions, etc.  My plight covered by Malayalam Manorama, The Hindu, Deepika, Deccan Chronicle, etc.. and are at my face book account. Shall I await for an early justice from the Authorities concerned within my last days and which will light to effectively to formation of New safety measures to self employed personals and prevent such bad experiences suffering by me and family.

The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don't even know the difference between fatwa and appeal.  A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa).

Adams criticized the claims to universal authority made by the Roman Catholic Church, which may well be the foundation upon which wording of Article 11 were based.  While it is true that Adams signed the aforementioned Treaty, it should be noted that he also signed the Declaration of Independence and Bill of Rights; both of which serve to further support Adams‚Äô words as being misconstrued.  That Congress unanimously signed the Treaty is absurd when one acknowledges the whole translation issue.        John Adams was both a devout Christian, and an independent thinker.  In a letter to Benjamin Rush, Adams credited religion with the success of his ancestors since their migration to the New World in the 1630s.  He also believed that regular church service was beneficial to man's moral sense. In 1796, Adams denounced political opponent  Thomas Paine's deistic criticisms of Christianity in The Age of Reason, saying, "The Christian religion is, above all the religions that ever prevailed or existed in ancient or modern times, the religion of wisdom, virtue, equity and humanity, let the Blackguard Paine say what he will.‚Äù    In light of Adams‚Äô Christianity, it is highly improbable that translations from English to Arabic were accurately transcribed.  It is far more plausible that he was rejecting the claims of ‚Äúuniversal authority‚Äù proclaimed by the Roman Catholic Church than anything remotely dismissing the foundation upon the Christian religion.          Adams twice served as the Vice-President under President George Washington.  The words of our esteemed first President, included in his Farewell Address, further dispute any notion that these United States of America are not founded upon the Christian religion; ‚ÄúAnd let us with caution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without religion. Whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined education on minds of peculiar structure, reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle.‚Äù  The words of James Madison, the Father of Our Constitution, clearly contradict the notion that America is not a Christian Nation; ‚ÄùWe have staked the whole of all our political Institutions upon the capacity of mankind for self-government, upon the capacity of each and all of us to govern ourselves, to control ourselves, to sustain ourselves according to the Ten Commandments of God.‚Äù  While Puerto Rico is a territory of the U.S., they have yet to gain Statehood.  Indigenous languages have yet to take precedence over the English language in any of our States.  Your argument is a moot point until such time as they earn said Statehood.  We are all very much aware the U.S. is not Israel; restating the obvious is senseless, especially when it is irrelevant to the point at hand.  Perhaps it is you who ‚Äúshould read more?‚Äù",1,0

Erdoƒüan inherited a debt of $23.5 billion to the IMF, which was reduced to $0.9 billion in 2012. He decided not to sign a new deal. Turkey's debt to the IMF was thus declared to be completely paid and he announced that the IMF could borrow from Turkey.  In 2010, five-year credit default swaps for Turkey's sovereign debt were trading at a record low of 1.17%, below those of nine EU member countries and Russia.  In 2002, the Turkish Central Bank had $26.5 billion in reserves. This amount reached $92.2 billion in 2011. During Erdoƒüan's leadership. Inflation fell from 32% to 9.0% in 2004.  Under Erdoƒüan's government, the number of airports in Turkey increased from 26 to 50.  Between 2002 and 2011, another 13500 km of expressway were built.  For the first time in Turkish history, high speed railway lines were constructed, and the country's high-speed train service began in 2009. In 8 years, 1076 km of railway were built and 5449 km of railway renewed.  Erdogan put greater investments into the healthcare system than any predecessor. As part of the reforms, the "Green Card" program, which provides free health benefits to the poor.  Erdoƒüan increased Education spending from 7.5 billion lira in 2002 to 34 billion lira in 2011, the highest share of the national budget given to one ministry and number of universities in Turkey nearly doubled, from 98 in 2002 to 186 in October 2012.

The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don't even know the difference between fatwa and appeal.  A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa).  We expect apology from your side for such a mistake",0,1

The very next days after delivery of the car, I noticed some cloudy parts and bubbles on the driver and co-driver door of the car. then I spoke to the car dealership about the problem they notice the problem and send my car to their Maruti Suzuki Authorised service station on 02-01-2017 for fixing the problem.  After 15 days, the same problem was reoccurred. When I took my car to the Dealer (One-up Motors (Maruti Suzuki), Alambagh, Lucknow ‚Äì 226005) they again sent it to service station for rectification of the problems and delivered the car to me after two days.  The same problem has again been noticed on 13-02-2017. After just 20 days  again i.e. 24-02-17 the same problem has been noticed on the entire body of the car.  When I visit again the authorised service station of the dealership they refused to resolve the problem and misbehaved with me.  Today i.e. On 23.03.2017 My car is still under repair with Oneup Moters Arambagh from last 20 days.  I brought the car for use my old parents and not to send it repeatedly to the service station for repairs or fixing problems. My father is suffering from heart ‚ù§ problems.

So do not take from among them allies until they emigrate for the cause of Allah . But if they turn away, then seize them and kill them wherever you find them and take not from among them any ally or helper.‚Äù [Link: https://quran.com/4/89 ] Translation: Kill all Muslims who leave Islam.   2. Quran: 2/1 : ‚ÄúAlif, Lam, Meem.‚Äù [Link: https://quran.com/2/1  ] Translation: Allah and his messengers are always right, and the Quran cannot be doubted‚Äù 3. Quran: 8/12 : ‚Äú[Remember] when your Lord inspired to the angels, "I am with you, so strengthen those who have believed. I will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieved, so strike [them] upon the necks and strike from them every fingertip".‚Äù [Link: https://quran.com/8/12 , https://quran.com/8/60 ] Translation: Terrorize all non-believers and people who do not agree with Islam. 4.

Those are the worst of creatures.‚Äù [Link: https://quran.com/98/6 ] Translation: ‚ÄúPeople of the Scripture (Jews, Christian and Sabians) and Polytheists (Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs, Jains) are all vilest of creatures that deserve no mercy.‚Äù 5. Quran: 4/3  : ‚ÄúAnd if you fear that you will not deal justly with the orphan girls, then marry those that please you of [other] women, two or three or four. But if you fear that you will not be just, then [marry only] one or those your right hand possesses. That is more suitable that you may not incline [to injustice].‚Äù [Link: https://quran.com/4/3] Translation: ‚ÄúTwo, three, four..!!‚Äù 6.

There are more than 1000 registered parties who didn't even contest 2014 Lok Sabha Election, and EC cannot de-register a party] -> Step 2 - Donate all your black money to your party in parts, each part should be less than 20,000. You can make infinite such donations, and say that they came from people. [According to the RP Act 1951, the political parties are not required to report (to the Election Commission of India (ECI)) the name of the individuals or organizations from whom they have received donations of amount less than Rs.20,000.] -> Step 3 - Go to bank, deposit all this amount in the party's account. [No need to pay any income tax. Political parties are 100% exempted from income tax] -> Step 4 - Withdraw the amount as and when you need, in 50/100/500/2000 rupee notes - It is all white. [Since Political Parties are not under RTI, you can't ask them how they spent their money] ENJOY YOUR WEALTH...!!!! *Moral of the Story:- All political parties are same.

hasoc_english_312942,"Pigeral : If you have problems with Muslim Azan then you must have problem with Hindu Aarti too. Both cause noise pollution.   Agniveer : There is difference.  1. How many times have you woken up at 4:30 in morning because of noise from Hindu Aarti in temples? Zero.   How many times have you woken up at 4:30 in morning because of noise from Azan in mosques? 365 times in a year (if you live within 5 km radius of a mosque).   Zero vs 365 settles everything.   Even if Aarti loudspeaker in your locality starts at 4:30 in full volume, you can simply go to the priest and he will reduce it. Just try doing it with a Moulvi in a mosque and see if you come back in single piece.   Pigeral : Huh, and what about your Ganesh Yatra, Hanuman Yatra? Don't they make noise? Stop them.   Agniveer : How many times in a year do Ganesh Chaturthi and Hanuman Jayanti come?   Pigeral : At least 10 days.   Agniveer : And how many times does Azan happen on loudspeaker in a year?   Pigeral :   Agniveer : Why silent? Let me help you. 365*5 = 1825. And then in addition, there are rallies, bike stunts, processions etc on Prophet's B'Day, Eid and Muharram etc.   So it is 10 vs 1825+. Are 10 and 1825 same?   Pigeral : Wrong is wrong. There is no bigger or smaller wrong.   Agniveer : Ok then, your 34/36/38 waist size is also wrong. Come to shape before commenting on our concerns on Azan.   Pigeral : How can you compare my personal fitness issue with an issue of 20% minorities?   Agniveer : Same way as you compared 10 with 1825+.   Pigeral :   Agniveer : Why silent?   Pigeral : Look, you can't interfere in others' religion. India is multicultural society. Every religion has equal rights.   Agniveer : Equal rights? Do we have equal rights? A Muslim can marry 4 women at a time and divorce them at will. A Hindu is jailed for doing same. Where are equal rights? And where are equal rights for Muslim women? You just need equal rights of noise. And you don't care about plight of 10 crore Muslim women?   Look, equal rights come with equal responsibilities. You follow equal laws, you will get equal rights. You act as some special hero, your a$$ will be kicked.   And finally, there is another solid difference. There is strong correlation between density of Azan and terror. Find out the places on earth where   1. Azan is maximum (lets call it Place 1) 2. Aarti is maximum (lets call it Place 2)  Then find out how many world's top terrorists/terror organisations do Place 1 group and Place 2 group produce. That is the ultimate litmus test on which noise is dangerous and which is harmless.   Pigeral :   Agniveer : Why silent?   Pigeral : Who are you man?   Agniveer : A proud Hindu. A proud idol worshipper. A proud Jihadi-hater. A proud Indian. Agniveer is the name.   ~ Vashi Sharma Agniveer",0,1

Though Indira Gandhi has been rated by you among the greatest Indians, but I don't feel she has done anything Great to be on this list. We Sikhs don't hold her in high esteem. HOW CAN YOU CALL HER A GREAT INDIAN WHEN SHE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE UNACCOUNTED DEATHS OF THOUSANDS OF INNOCENT SIKHS WHO ARE A MINORITY COMMUNITY? She only created Bhindranwale to counter the Akalis in Punjab & is responsible for the rise of Religious Extremism in the state AS PRIOR TO THAT, THERE WAS NO RELIGIOUS EXTREMISM IN PUNJAB. Even after her death, 20,000 Sikhs were murdered all over India (4,000 in Delhi alone) from 31st October till 4th November 1984 in a cold blooded Genocide led by the SECULAR CONRESS PARTY OF INDIA. Sikhs were burnt alive in front of their families, women were gang raped & their property was set on fire. The mobs were laughing as they were killing the Sikhs. The goons were led by local Congress MPS with Govt voter lists in their hands to aid them in finding Sikh houses & properties & were exhorting non Sikhs to kill as many Sikhs as possible. The local Congress MPs even gave the rioters money telling them that the person who will kill the maximum number of Sikhs will get the greatest amount apart from other incentives. From Oct 31 till Nov 3, blood curdling cries of ‚ÄúKHOON KA BADLA KHOON SE LENGE ‚Äì WE WILL AVENGE BLOOD WITH BLOOD‚Äù were broadcast on Delhi Doordarshan & even the renowned actor of Bollywood, Amitabh Bacchan was instigating the people to kill the Sikhs. The Congress was in power at the Centre at the time of the Riots, & P.V.Narasimha Rao was the Home Minister, but he did nothing till Nov 2 despite knowing about the carnage & the Delhi Police just stood as mute spectators instead of protecting the Sikhs & let the bloody carnage to continue as directed by their political masters. Most of the Senior Police Officers deliberately went on leave from Nov 1 to 3 as directed by their political masters.The Army was deliberately not called & were only told to come on the evening of Nov 2, but still there was no one to guide them through the streets of Delhi. Then on Nov 3, after their quench for blood was satisfied, as if by remote control, everything stopped. It was nothing but a cold blooded genocide directed out by the senior Congress politicians against the Sikhs. Had prompt action been taken on the first day of rioting, this Genocide would have never taken place. IT IS A MATTER OF GREAT SHAME FOR THE ENTIRE COUNTRY THAT STILL THE PERPETRATORS OF THE 1984 SIKH GENOCIDE HAVE NOT BEEN ARRESTED NOR ANY PROPER LEGAL CONVICTION TAKEN AGAINST EVEN A SINGLE PERSON UNLIKE THE MULTIPLE CONVICTIONS IN THE 2002 POST GODHRA RIOTS WHICH HAPPENED MUCH LATER DESPITE REPEATED PLEAS BY THE VICTIM‚ÄôS FAMILIES. The killers & murderers are roaming scot free & some are even ministers in the ruling Congress Govt. NEITHER ANY PROPER COMPENSATION BEEN PAID TO THE VICTIMS OF THE 84 RIOTS, NOR HAS ANY PROPER APOLOGY BEEN GIVEN OR ANY MEMORIAL CONSTRUCTED IN THEIR MEMORY BY THE GOVERNMENT. UNLESS THE PERPETRATORS OF THESE HEINOUS CRIMES ARE BROUGHT TO BOOK, I WON‚ÄôT BE SURPRISED IF THIS CARNAGE IS AGAIN REPEATED. THE CONGRESS GOVT IS STILL IN DENIAL ABOUT THIS BLOODY CARNAGE AS MANY OF THEIR SENIOR MINISTERS ARE INVOLVED IN THIS GENOCIDE & APART FROM ISSUING HALF HEARTED APOLOGIES WHENEVER IT WAS CONVENIENT TO THEM, THEY HAVEN‚ÄôT DONE ANYTHING AT ALL. THEY ARE HOPING AGAINST HOPE THAT BY LIVING IN DENIAL, THEY CAN MAKE PEOPLE FORGET THIS TROUBLED PHASE OF HISTORY, BUT THEY ARE GROSSLY WRONG AS HISTORY NEVER FORGETS ITSELF. UNLESS THE GUILTY ARE NOT BROUGHT TO BOOK, IT WILL LEAD TO A VERY FRUSTRATED & ANGRY GENERATION PRONE TO DRUGS & VIOLENCE.",0,1

hasoc_english_313617,"(Representative image) Thiruvananthapuram: According to an intelligence report submitted to the state police chief seven months ago, and accessed by TOI, two 'recognised' religious conversion centres in Kozhikode and Malappuram converted as many as 5,793 people to Islam between 2011 and 2015. Conversions happening in unrecognised centres in the state could be much higher, fear top government officials who, for obvious reasons, didn't want to be named. The report states that almost half of those who converted to Islam are women, and that the majority of these women (76%) are below 35 years. Of those converted, 4,719 were Hindus and the remaining 1,074 mostly Christian. The conversions happened at Tharbiyathul Islam Sabha in Kozhikode and Monunsthil Islam Sabha at Ponnani, two traditional religious institutions in the state 'authorized' to convert people from other religions to Islam. The police report, prepared in connection with the conversion of Nimisha alias Fathima -currently missing along with 20 others from the state and suspected to have joined Islamic State -says that a detailed inquiry is required to verify whether these conversions were under duress, whether there were enticements involved or were voluntary . "Inquiries are required to know whether this will affect the communal harmony , internal security of the state and nation. A detailed SSB (state special branch) inquiry in Kasaragod, Kannur, Alappuzha, Thiruvananthapuram and Palakkad is recommended to unearth the details," the report, sent by then Kasaragod SP , A Srinivas, who probed the Nimisha case in November 2015, said.

She has previously worked for over 7 years in financing road rehabilitation worldwide. Dr. Dorhoi also works on both financing and managing risk in Formula 1 racing as part of the different financing requirements.  Thank you to F√©d√©ration Internationale de l‚ÄôAutomobile (FIA) Foundation for preparing and publicizing the progress made in the implementation of the goals set by the ‚ÄúUnited Nations Road safety in 2015‚Äù. The report was prepared by the World Health Organization.  At the event the book ‚ÄúGoals for change, partners for action‚Äù the Annual report of 2015 of the F√©d√©ration Internationale de l‚ÄôAutomobile (FIA)Foundation was also featured.  The report enthusiastically embraces the UN Decade of Action for Road Safety and the UN Sustainable Development Goals. To be more exact, the energy goals for development translated into a Global Fuel Economy Initiative in which the foundation is helping governments to develop global and regional programs, to find evidence of effectiveness at national and city level, and to bring in donors to support the national policies and initiatives.  In United States about 40% of the traffic related deaths were reduced in the last few years. The 2020 United Nations Millennium Goals in relation to road safety are to reduce the deaths due to traffic by 50 %compared to today‚Äôs number.  For Dr. Dorhoi the connection with the F√©d√©ration Internationale de l‚ÄôAutomobile (FIA) Foundation is blessed by her long time dedication to the causes of Ayrton Senna.

The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don't even know the difference between fatwa and appeal.  A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa).  We expect apology from your side for such a mistake",0,1

But why china is so adament to have Arunachal Pradesh as part of Tibet ? Is it mere Riligioustic or Geo-politics or Militaristics or Expansionist mindset of China ? Why China is playing a zero-sum game knowing fully well that India will not part with Arunachal Pradesh  at any cost ?   It is undoubtedly clear to everybody that the CORE GROWTH ENGINE of china's economy has been SUSTAINABLE RIPARIAN TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM which has two componants as LOCAL & GLOBAL features.   It is the GLOBAL FEATURE which makes ARUNACHAL PRADESH of India via NAGALAND as GATEWAY for china to the SHORTEST riparian transportation system based upon RIVER KALADIN of MYANMAR to the BAY of BENGAL (through Sittwe Sea Port of Myanmar which will eventually form KOLKATA-DHAKA-SITTWE economic corridor powered by 'BANGLADESH-BHUTAN-INDIA-NEPAL MULTILATERAL HIGHWAY' linked with INDIA-MYANMAR-THAILAND TRILATERAL HIGHWAY thereby effectively replacing NORTH EAST of INDIA as HUB of ACT EAST POLICY of INDIA with BENGAL, INDIA) as current global riparian transportation system takes too much times & distances to cover. That is why CHINA keeps disputing the ARUNACHAL PRADESH thereby giving much irritation to the India and preventing both powerhouses to realise full mutual prosperities.  But this ZERO-SUM game can be reversed by MIGHTY RIVER BRAHMAPUTRA. Having RORO facility at DHUBURI & elevated the status of DHUBURI, ASSAM, INDIA to the status of INTERNATIONAL SPECIAL ECONOMIC ZONE , river brahmaputra can provide peaceful & sustainable riparian solution to above discussed problem and for this both India & China Government have to build following multilateral economic corridor powered by inland, road & rail networks (taking both Bangladesh & Bhutan Government on-board) , namely , "DHAKA-DHUBURI-THIMPHU-LHASA-BEIJING (DDTLB) ECONOMIC CORRIDOR ".",0,1

Sometimes, it's a group; grandma, grandpa, mom and dad; so each one of them is able to do other stuff while spending a part of the day with the child. Sometimes both parents divide the responsibility. Sometimes, one parent prioritizes work and the other one is a full time caregiver. Sometimes you hire dependable help. No configuration is wrong. Economic factors also play a role in the decision. What I find a bit jarring is that she almost seems to shame working mothers for bringing up their children like a "puppy".

Hazinagar, malda, chandanagar, dulagarh and a number of places where Hindus are being targeted yet. We are living under fear as mamta government providing full support to these miscreants. Local Bengali medias are not not allowed to show the current situation of west Bengal. We urge central government to look into the matter seriously or else West Bengal will soon become mini Bangladesh or mini Pakistan. Mumtaz Beghum government is arresting any media channel which is trying to broadcast these muslim riots where they are butchering hindus.  At present, there is no problem in proper kolkata, but conditions in rural & small cities far from kolkata is changing fast.. search in google about tehatta, hajinagar, chandannagar , khagragarh , kanning ,malda , murshidabad etc etc ....even bangladeshi govt is now accusing west bengal govt for providing safe house for bangladeshi terrorists",1,0

hasoc_english_314596,"Nice write up. However, before concluding that no gains are in sight, let us keep our eyes open and look for the gains which are overlooked in this article.                                                                                                                                      1)This could still be a paradigm shift. Don't forget that currency has been growing rapidly in our economy. In the words of former RBi governer Subbu Rao "going up by 15 percent year on year since financial year 2015/16, significantly faster than the trend rate of 10.7 percent over the previous three years.Even increase in e-transactions does not sufficiently explain this increase in demand for currency, suggesting that some other dynamic was at play. The Government‚Äôs surprise move was evidently in response to this uncharacteristic expansion of currency in circulation, clearly out of line with the pace of expansion of economic activity."  This trend would definitely be arrested if the govt. is serious and continue its efforts sincerely. And the economy could see much lower cash in circulation.                                                                                                                                   2) temporary squeeze in cash is pushing many to move into electronic payments. Convenience and efficiency  will make them move away from cash permanently wherever possible.                                                                         3) With much less cash in circulation, black money locked up in land and gold would not be easily converted into cash. This could reduce the illegal activities too                                                                                                                        4) Lower land and apartment prices would benefit economy eventually                                                                                                       5)All the 12lakh crore reported to be put back into banking system has left a trail.

What you should know about Turkey's President, Recap Tayyip Erdogan:  The Turkish economy between 2002 and 2012 caused a growth of 64% in real GDP and a 43% increase in GDP per capita.  Erdoƒüan inherited a debt of $23.5 billion to the IMF, which was reduced to $0.9 billion in 2012. He decided not to sign a new deal. Turkey's debt to the IMF was thus declared to be completely paid and he announced that the IMF could borrow from Turkey.  In 2010, five-year credit default swaps for Turkey's sovereign debt were trading at a record low of 1.17%, below those of nine EU member countries and Russia.  In 2002, the Turkish Central Bank had $26.5 billion in reserves. This amount reached $92.2 billion in 2011. During Erdoƒüan's leadership. Inflation fell from 32% to 9.0% in 2004.  Under Erdoƒüan's government, the number of airports in Turkey increased from 26 to 50.  Between 2002 and 2011, another 13500 km of expressway were built.  For the first time in Turkish history, high speed railway lines were constructed, and the country's high-speed train service began in 2009. In 8 years, 1076 km of railway were built and 5449 km of railway renewed.  Erdogan put greater investments into the healthcare system than any predecessor. As part of the reforms, the "Green Card" program, which provides free health benefits to the poor.  Erdoƒüan increased Education spending from 7.5 billion lira in 2002 to 34 billion lira in 2011, the highest share of the national budget given to one ministry and number of universities in Turkey nearly doubled, from 98 in 2002 to 186 in October 2012.

hasoc_english_314947,"My life with family as an Er. Entrepreneur have been spoiled due to Dubious Actions by Vengeful Officials of corrupted  ISI, SBI, KFC, etc. From 1982 to 1997, they have played with my life as an SSI unit proprietor.  During 1990, I tried justice  from ISI and SBI through Kerala State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission  and in 1992,  an appeal filed with National CDRC, both Commissions having Judicial as well as Non Judicial Officers found some technical reasons to deny me Justice. I had no advocate to sue my plight. All members of both Commissions realized the truth, but with the help of LIMITATION Act. But my inexperience and obligation towards the system, I became silent and continue efforts to revive and rehabilitation of my Sick SSI unit with full cooperation of Industries Department. On 7.7.1995, I paid to KFC on One Time Settlement in full spirit of letter  of KFC dated 23.6.95. But my inability to please the corrupted Officials, the unit taken over by Revenue Recovery Act on 30.5.95 was kept with custody of KFC. I was at  Head Office of  KFC, Trivandrum  after my OTS payment, till a road accident at Palauan over Trivandrum on 6.3.97.  I was under treatment from Medical College  Trivandrum, Kannur District Hospital, City Hospital Mangalore, etc and in least of 1997, I visited KFC  HO with the help Crutches, and realised that instead of blood, water is flowing through the Officials and the same day visit Kerala State CDRC and very next day filed a complaint against KFC. After three months, the Commission received reply from KFC with copy to me. On the basis of KFC's reply, the Commission started dictating Judgement and Dismissed my Complaint directing to Sue in Civil Court. Next day I filed a Review Petition besides few other. The Hearing Day when I stand with help of Crutches and started to express my view, the Commission President threatened on huge cost to be Ordered against me. I managed to escape the so called Consumer Court with fear.  But still I know that any one have common sense will award justice to me from National and State CDRC on both cases.  After ,1977 to 2009, I was under acute mental depression. I started writing to Central And State Governments and hence passed 5 pages G O, in 2010 direct KFC to settle issues at Board Level and to write to various Ministries of Government of India to enquire and compensated me due to Dubious Actions by ISI and SBI.  But my efforts continue yet, the Corrupted Officials also continue to resist my efforts at my 67th age.  What we understand from the synopsis of plight-  Officials have good salary and support from all cadre of Government to save corrupted ones with the backing of so called Provision in court both Judicial and Quasi Judicial, like CDRCs, Human Rights Commissions, etc.  My plight covered by Malayalam Manorama, The Hindu, Deepika, Deccan Chronicle, etc.. and are at my face book account. Shall I await for an early justice from the Authorities concerned within my last days and which will light to effectively to formation of New safety measures to self employed personals and prevent such bad experiences suffering by me and family.

The Kargil war, which commenced on May 1999, was announced after the infiltration of Pakistani troops and Kashmiri militants into Kargil district of Jammu and Kashmir and along the Line of Control (LOC). The intrusion into the area, that divided the Indian territory of Ladakh from the northern areas of the state, had come as a complete surprise to the Indian army and Operation Vijay was immediately launched to flush our enemies from the Kargil sector.   Pakistani soldiers    MASTERMIND BEHIND THE ATTACK  Pervez Musharraf, the then Army Chief of Pakistan, is said to be the brain box behind the attack. Musharraf carefully charted out the intrusion plan, without any specifics from the then Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. He was supported and assisted by Leiutenant General Mohammed Aziz. It is said that Musharraf executed the plan while Atal Bihari Vajpayee had responded to Nawaz Sharif's invitation to Lahore and where the duo signed the Lahore declaration.   Conventional modes of war were used    MODE OF FIGHTING  Well-equipped with war weapons, both sides were prepared to launch attacks on one another. The 18,000 feet high-altitude battle in the rocky terrain was fought under extreme low temperatures, in a conventional manner, despite both sides possessing nuclear weapons. India positioned five infantry divisions, five independent brigades and 44 battalions of paramilitary troops to Kashmir and further deployed 60 frontline aircrafts.   Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh with army and air force officers salute at the India Gate on Vijay Diwas    THE INDIAN AIR FORCE  On May 24, 1999, it was decided that the operation would be joined by the Indian Air Force (IAF). However, it was stressed that the IAF would not cross the LOC at any cost. The IAF launched bomb attacks on the enemy within its boundary. Tiger Hill, one of the highest peaks in the Drass-Kargil area of the state, became the focal point during the war. After a fierce war of more than sixty days, and with the support of the international community, India recaptured Tiger Hill and pushed the Pakistani forces back into its territory.   School children display a national flag over a displayed Indian army tank to commemorate the day    INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE TO THE CONFLICT  Pakistan's infiltration to India and the military clash were deeply criticized by many countries and attracted the United States' intervention into the crisis. As per a report in the Daily Times, a leading newspaper in Pakistan, India gained the confidence of the US while Pakistan 'lost its credibility in the eyes of both India and Pakistan'. The international community began building pressure on the Pakistani forces and threatened them to withdraw or face isolation. Russia and Israel also came forward to support India's stance.

hasoc_english_315010,"Top 10 tricks played by the media to control the masses:   1. Project 'everything is fine' in default mode- even if they are not - thus lulling sheople into complacency. ( buffer routine 'news', sports, celebrity gossip, science, etc. ). This technique is used by shepherds rearing sheep for slaughter.  2. Emphasise individual identity (nationality, religion, state etc.), to ensure subconscious separation ( the divide and rule policy ).   3. Contrive 'voice of the poor' / 'protest power' etc., though these do not exist. This deludes people to 'think' they are in control.   4. Stage events ( 'astro turfing', 'shills', 'fake witnesses', 'crisis actors' etc. ), to either fabricate 'mass movement', create paranoia or extreme fear, or distract masses from real issues.  5. Use sports, celebrities and gossip etc., to divert from real issues ( and shape public opinion ).  6. Play key supporting role for big sponsored false flag events, hoaxes, etc. ( for wars, laws, create fear, distract, etc.) Many of your favourite news anchors and journalists are in fact establishment ( intelligence ) officers.  7. Portray government as victim of crime ( cheating, assault, etc. ), so that the sheople would not later protest draconian laws against themselves.  8. Manufacture extreme fear, through exaggerated claims of disease, enemy power, terrorism, etc., ( to support wars, desensitise or divide people, for example )   9. 'Media black out', ( non reporting leads to ignorance or dumbing down ), or reporting with malevolence, ( stereotyping or demonisation ) - the most common control technique.   10. Lastly, and most secretive, the media is owned by a handful of corporations and suppresses other sources of information. Media forms  the 'matrix' - a web of illusions to deceive the masses, and along with 'politics' are both secretly owned by banking families.   Next time your favourite news media 'breaks news', ask yourself: "Is this true, or is this their latest shill / hoax / false flag operation"?",0,1

hasoc_english_315902,"The Sikhs are a very peace loving community & don‚Äôt seek criminal retribution against anyone. Our Gurus have taught us to help other people in need irrespective of their caste or creed. During the days of the Mughals, the Sikhs used to protect the Hindu families & their women from the Muslims. All that they want from the Govt is that a proper & unbiased legal action be taken against the accused in order to infuse some sense of hope into the victims‚Äô families of which they have been deprived for so many years. The Govt also has to provide adequate money & resettlement options for many of the victims‚Äô families who lost their breadwinners in the Genocide & are still living in urban ghettos.  THIS INCIDENT HAS REALLY SHAKEN THE FAITH OF THE SIKH MINORITY COMMUNITY IN THE INDIAN GOVERNMENT & MANY OF THE AFFECTED FAMILIES HAVE LEFT THE COUNTRY. I distinctly remember those fateful days as I was studying in school in Delhi at that time. For the first time in my life, I felt like being a member of a Minority community in India. Even now, in Delhi & adjoining areas of the Hindi speaking Cow belt, Sikhs are subjected to racist taunts, humiliated & made fun of them due to their unique identity. Even I was subjected to these humiliating taunts during my school days in Delhi.  Her only qualification was that she was the daughter of Jawaharlal Nehru. Nehru was responsible for the Partition of India. You can read the book written by Maulana Abdul Kalam Azad in case you have any doubts.  It is very sad that even 27 years after the massacre of innocent Sikhs that took place between Nov 1-3 1984 following Indira's death no justice has been delivered either to the victims of this heinous GENOCIDE nor any of its perpetrators (mostly local Congress MLAs & their Goons) have been tried or brought to book. According to the BBC, early 20,000 SIKHS were massacred in broad daylight all over India within 4 days & the State Police (like the Delhi Police) did nothing to stop this brutal ETHNIC CLEANSING. They merely stood there like mute spectators watching the grisly spectacle being enacted & at some instances, even colluding with the perpetrators. It is not possible to commit such a large scale murder within such a short span of time without the connivance of local Congress MLAs (or maybe even Senior Congress leaders) who, like in DELHI & elsewhere, incited the mobs with Vitriolic speeches to kill every Sikh & gave their Goons the voters' lists to aid them in tracking down Sikh Homes, freely offered money, distributed arms & offered financial rewards to their Goons to kill the Sikhs as most of these Murderers were illiterate. THEIR SENIOR MINISTERS LIKE JAGDISH TYTLER & KAMAL NATH ARE INVOLVED IN THIS GENOCIDE. During this time, Sikhs were burnt alive in front of their families, killed with Iron rods, & their women were taken & raped & their places of worship desecrated. For the Sikh Community it was like another HOLOCAUST. More casualties happened in CONGRESS ruled states (obviously).The State Police became deaf to the repeated pleas by the affected Sikh families for protection as the irate mobs continued their grisly act in on one Sikh locality after another. In many Sikh localities, entire Sikh communities were wiped out. There are photos of people laughing as they were beating the Sikhs to death.   I was 13 years old in Delhi when this carnage took place. I have very vivid & painful memories of those days. I am also a Sikh, but luckily we were safe as our residence was in the Delhi Cantonment which was a secure area. Had I been in an insecure area, I would have met the same fate. My Father picked up me & my Sister from our School bus on Oct 31, 1984 as we had to walk a slight distance to our house. I remember the entire city being under curfew, between Nov 1-4, 1984 & I did not go to school for a month. An eerie silence of Death was pervading over the entire city. For the first time I felt being someone from the Minority community who is living in a country being ruled by the Majority community. I remember seeing black fumes coming from nearby Janakpuri on Nov 1. We had to install Security guards outside our house for a month before things calmed down though we too got threatening phone calls that a mob is coming to our house too to kill us.   The Government has only adopted delaying tactics till now (even 27 years after the carnage) by forming committees after committees to probe into this MASS GENOCIDE, despite repeated testimonies from the Victims' families in Court whose near & dear ones where killed in these riots, but sadly, JUSTICE HAS NOT BEEN DELIVERED EVEN TILL NOW & the perpetrators & their goons are still roaming scot free. It is obvious the Government is trying to shield them & some Big names are also involved.  I feel the Sikh Community should file a case in the International Criminal Court at The Hague as the Indian Govt has failed to deliver justice to the affected families & till the present Govt is there, no justice will be delivered. JUSTICE DELAYED IS JUSTICE DENIED. Till the Indian Govt delivers prompt & effective justice to the victims of 1984 Anti Sikh Pogroms, I won't be surprised if this carnage is again repeated & it will remain as a DARK CHAPTER IN INDIA'S HUMAN RIGHTS RECORD.",0,1

Erdoƒüan inherited a debt of $23.5 billion to the IMF, which was reduced to $0.9 billion in 2012. He decided not to sign a new deal. Turkey's debt to the IMF was thus declared to be completely paid and he announced that the IMF could borrow from Turkey.  In 2010, five-year credit default swaps for Turkey's sovereign debt were trading at a record low of 1.17%, below those of nine EU member countries and Russia.  In 2002, the Turkish Central Bank had $26.5 billion in reserves. This amount reached $92.2 billion in 2011. During Erdoƒüan's leadership. Inflation fell from 32% to 9.0% in 2004.  Under Erdoƒüan's government, the number of airports in Turkey increased from 26 to 50.  Between 2002 and 2011, another 13500 km of expressway were built.  For the first time in Turkish history, high speed railway lines were constructed, and the country's high-speed train service began in 2009. In 8 years, 1076 km of railway were built and 5449 km of railway renewed.  Erdogan put greater investments into the healthcare system than any predecessor. As part of the reforms, the "Green Card" program, which provides free health benefits to the poor.  Erdoƒüan increased Education spending from 7.5 billion lira in 2002 to 34 billion lira in 2011, the highest share of the national budget given to one ministry and number of universities in Turkey nearly doubled, from 98 in 2002 to 186 in October 2012.

Come out with positive approach and introduce incentives to IT return filers ( learn from Pakistan, IT assessee gets discount in purchase of Car )  3.

Introduce medical insurance / life insurance on basis of average ITR filled... like coverage upto twice of Gross Income in ITR filled for mediclaim and ten times risk cover in case of life insurance   5. Introduce Pension after 65 yrs of age on the basis of tax paid by tax payer during his working life..  Let honest taxpayers get certain direct benefits....   As on today, 3.3% of Indian population is filling ITRs as compared to 8% of China...adding large agriculturists to Income Tax may shoot the figure to more than 10% .... it may help you to cool your tax terrorism mindset and a tax compliant nation ...üòä *LET'S SPREAD THIS TO HONEST TAX PAYERS*",0,1

I have very few memories of him. I have more memories of how it feels NOT to have a father. I also remember how much I used to hate Pakistan & Pakistanis because they killed my Dad. I used to hate Muslims too because I thought all Muslims are Pakistanis. When I was 6 years old, I tried to stab a lady in a burkha. Because for some strange reason, I thought she was responsible for my father‚Äôs death. My mother held me back and made me understand that Pakistan did not kill my dad, war killed him. It took me a while to know but today I do. I have learnt to let go of my hate. It was not easy but its not difficult. If I can do it, so can you. Today, I am a soldier too, just like my dad. I fight for peace between India and Pakistan. Because if there was no war between us, my father would still be here. I am making this video because I want the Governments of both countries to stop pretending and solve the problem. If France & Germany can become friends after 2 World Wars, if Japan & USA can put their past behind and work towards progress, then why can‚Äôt we?? Majority of regular Indians and Pakistanis want peace, not war. I am questioning the calibre of leadership of both nations. We cannot dream of becoming a first world country with third world leadership. Please pull your socks up. Talk to each other and get the job done.Enough state sponsored terrorism. Enough state-sponsored spies. Enough state-sponsored hatred. Enough people have died on both sides of the border. Enough is Enough.

Erdoƒüan inherited a debt of $23.5 billion to the IMF, which was reduced to $0.9 billion in 2012. He decided not to sign a new deal. Turkey's debt to the IMF was thus declared to be completely paid and he announced that the IMF could borrow from Turkey.  In 2010, five-year credit default swaps for Turkey's sovereign debt were trading at a record low of 1.17%, below those of nine EU member countries and Russia.  In 2002, the Turkish Central Bank had $26.5 billion in reserves. This amount reached $92.2 billion in 2011. During Erdoƒüan's leadership. Inflation fell from 32% to 9.0% in 2004.  Under Erdoƒüan's government, the number of airports in Turkey increased from 26 to 50.  Between 2002 and 2011, another 13500 km of expressway were built.  For the first time in Turkish history, high speed railway lines were constructed, and the country's high-speed train service began in 2009. In 8 years, 1076 km of railway were built and 5449 km of railway renewed.  Erdogan put greater investments into the healthcare system than any predecessor. As part of the reforms, the "Green Card" program, which provides free health benefits to the poor.  Erdoƒüan increased Education spending from 7.5 billion lira in 2002 to 34 billion lira in 2011, the highest share of the national budget given to one ministry and number of universities in Turkey nearly doubled, from 98 in 2002 to 186 in October 2012.

It was very sad to see that your journalists don't even know the difference between fatwa and appeal.  A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa).

India is facing such shameful situation for the simple reason that like Pakistan (and Bangladesh) India too foolishly does not understand that the last word on India‚Äôs partition is yet to be written.    One more matter agitates a person like me born before independence and that too in Kota region of my native State of Rajasthan. We were brought up in a culture where a ‚ÄòSainik‚Äô laying down his life in a war was considered getting ‚ÄòMoksha‚Äô through ‚ÄòVeergati‚Äô [and we were told the stories of Rani Padmini and other ladies of Chittorgarh becoming ‚ÄòSati‚Äô because their husbands got ‚ÄòVeergati‚Äô in battle and Hada Rani (from Kota - Bundi given in marriage to Chittorgarh) cutting her head and sending it as a memento to her ‚Äòmadhosh‚Äô husband in order to motivate him to fight the battle against enemy and Rana Pratap never submitting to Akabar rather preferred to live in jungles while incessantly fighting to recover the lost forts and mother-land].   This culture has still remained but when  nowadays I see the soldiers and their officers dying (not in war against Pakistan) but like ‚Äòkeede-makode‚Äô (insects) and at the top of it are called ‚ÄòShaheed‚Äô (Martyrs), I get confused whether the culture in which we were brought up was right or the present culture ? (where as a Veteran Colonel said after 29/11 on a TV program that after training of merely 3 to 4 months Jihadi under the very nose of security forces at border etc come from Pakistan and kill the well and extensively trained & groomed Indian soldiers and their officers at Army camp / Corps headquarters)    But in any case, it is high time GOI realizes that earlier Congress party and now BJP headed by PM Modi and all other political parties in India have been and are incapable of solving Kashmir problem due to their communal mindset. Therefore before it is too late GOI should spare a meager amount of $ 4,400 for the launch of ‚ÄòUnited India Party‚Äô which alone can solve Kashmir and other problems being faced by India.   It is hoped that the Friends-of-India will constrain GOI to see reason as explained at:-       http://www.alwihdainfo.com/At-least-after-29-11-friends-should-advice-India-to-spend--4400-to-solve-Kashmir-problem_a45603.html   [Especially given the fact that India should not waste this opportunity where some Kashmiri Muslims are showing courage and patriotism to start office (with flag and board / banner) of pro-India national political party in Srinagar and in other parts of the valley where the writ of government of J&K and India does not run and on the contrary Pakistan supported Separatists have been able to inflict almost five months of shutdown on the people of Kashmir]  Regards  Email: hemraj_jain@yahoo.com",1,0

A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices.

He is doing nothing except making fool to our innocent countrymen. Now lemme prove my points.  When Modi would campaign for his party BJP (bhartiye jumla party) in 2014 general election, he promised that he would solve the case of Naxalites/Maoists. He promised that he would solve Kashmir issue and abrogate article 370. He promised that he would solve the problem of OROP for army men. He promised to rebut Pakistan in the harshest way possible. He promised to give we youngsters a job/a secured career. He promised to protect every woman from monsters. He promised to eliminate corruption. He promised to make India great again..He promised to bring LokPal...He promised to bring back black money from Swiss bank... But it's irony that he has done just opposite to what he had promised a couple of years ago. He has not fulfilled even a single promise that he made to us...I think he has cheated all of us... Our Jawans are being killed by bloody Naxals/Maoists or by incorrigible Pakistan..We youths are being deprived of jobs by scrapping many government posts and minimizing vacancy..This government is absolutely anti-government jobs...Farmers are committing suicide everyday...Women are being tortured openly...Nagaland and Kashmir are demanding freedom and shouting anti-India slogans in our national capital's JNU...China is making CPEC through Gilgit Baltistan without even caring for our concern.. I am asking u after all what do we have got by electing Mr. Modi ? Are we not cheated?? Still we all are happy and voting for Modi just because a few members of BJP are speaking against muslims and in support of Ram Mandir...Are we not fools?? Hating muslims is the only eligibility that forces us to support BJP??  Please realize the harsh truth that either BJP or Modi is not the party or the person we voted for..We have to change our perception...Our Jawans at he border are being mutilated and we are helpless..I am ashamed of my PM...

Entrepreneur have been spoiled due to Dubious Actions by Vengeful Officials of corrupted  ISI, SBI, KFC, etc. From 1982 to 1997, they have played with my life as an SSI unit proprietor.  During 1990, I tried justice  from ISI and SBI through Kerala State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission  and in 1992,  an appeal filed with National CDRC, both Commissions having Judicial as well as Non Judicial Officers found some technical reasons to deny me Justice. I had no advocate to sue my plight. All members of both Commissions realized the truth, but with the help of LIMITATION Act. But my inexperience and obligation towards the system, I became silent and continue efforts to revive and rehabilitation of my Sick SSI unit with full cooperation of Industries Department. On 7.7.1995, I paid to KFC on One Time Settlement in full spirit of letter  of KFC dated 23.6.95. But my inability to please the corrupted Officials, the unit taken over by Revenue Recovery Act on 30.5.95 was kept with custody of KFC. I was at  Head Office of  KFC, Trivandrum  after my OTS payment, till a road accident at Palauan over Trivandrum on 6.3.97.  I was under treatment from Medical College  Trivandrum, Kannur District Hospital, City Hospital Mangalore, etc and in least of 1997, I visited KFC  HO with the help Crutches, and realised that instead of blood, water is flowing through the Officials and the same day visit Kerala State CDRC and very next day filed a complaint against KFC. After three months, the Commission received reply from KFC with copy to me. On the basis of KFC's reply, the Commission started dictating Judgement and Dismissed my Complaint directing to Sue in Civil Court. Next day I filed a Review Petition besides few other. The Hearing Day when I stand with help of Crutches and started to express my view, the Commission President threatened on huge cost to be Ordered against me. I managed to escape the so called Consumer Court with fear.  But still I know that any one have common sense will award justice to me from National and State CDRC on both cases.  After ,1977 to 2009, I was under acute mental depression. I started writing to Central And State Governments and hence passed 5 pages G O, in 2010 direct KFC to settle issues at Board Level and to write to various Ministries of Government of India to enquire and compensated me due to Dubious Actions by ISI and SBI.  But my efforts continue yet, the Corrupted Officials also continue to resist my efforts at my 67th age.  What we understand from the synopsis of plight-  Officials have good salary and support from all cadre of Government to save corrupted ones with the backing of so called Provision in court both Judicial and Quasi Judicial, like CDRCs, Human Rights Commissions, etc.  My plight covered by Malayalam Manorama, The Hindu, Deepika, Deccan Chronicle, etc.. and are at my face book account. Shall I await for an early justice from the Authorities concerned within my last days and which will light to effectively to formation of New safety measures to self employed personals and prevent such bad experiences suffering by me and family.

The very next days after delivery of the car, I noticed some cloudy parts and bubbles on the driver and co-driver door of the car. then I spoke to the car dealership about the problem they notice the problem and send my car to their Maruti Suzuki Authorised service station on 02-01-2017 for fixing the problem.  After 15 days, the same problem was reoccurred. When I took my car to the Dealer (One-up Motors (Maruti Suzuki), Alambagh, Lucknow ‚Äì 226005) they again sent it to service station for rectification of the problems and delivered the car to me after two days.  The same problem has again been noticed on 13-02-2017. After just 20 days  again i.e. 24-02-17 the same problem has been noticed on the entire body of the car.  When I visit again the authorised service station of the dealership they refused to resolve the problem and misbehaved with me.  Today i.e. On 23.03.207 My car is still under repair with Oneup Moters Arambagh from last 20 days.  I brought the car for use my old parents and not to send it repeatedly to the service station for repairs or fixing problems. My father is suffering from heart ‚ù§ problems.

The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don't even know the difference between fatwa and appeal.  A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa).

The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don't even know the difference between fatwa and appeal.  A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices.

Erdoƒüan inherited a debt of $23.5 billion to the IMF, which was reduced to $0.9 billion in 2012. He decided not to sign a new deal. Turkey's debt to the IMF was thus declared to be completely paid and he announced that the IMF could borrow from Turkey.  In 2010, five-year credit default swaps for Turkey's sovereign debt were trading at a record low of 1.17%, below those of nine EU member countries and Russia.  In 2002, the Turkish Central Bank had $26.5 billion in reserves. This amount reached $92.2 billion in 2011. During Erdoƒüan's leadership. Inflation fell from 32% to 9.0% in 2004.  Under Erdoƒüan's government, the number of airports in Turkey increased from 26 to 50.  Between 2002 and 2011, another 13500 km of expressway were built.  For the first time in Turkish history, high speed railway lines were constructed, and the country's high-speed train service began in 2009. In 8 years, 1076 km of railway were built and 5449 km of railway renewed.  Erdogan put greater investments into the healthcare system than any predecessor. As part of the reforms, the "Green Card" program, which provides free health benefits to the poor.  Erdoƒüan increased Education spending from 7.5 billion lira in 2002 to 34 billion lira in 2011, the highest share of the national budget given to one ministry and number of universities in Turkey nearly doubled, from 98 in 2002 to 186 in October 2012.

There is no verse in Quran which restricts a Muslim to be friend of non muslims or kill any person who is not a muslim.

How many times have you woken up at 4:30 in morning because of noise from Hindu Aarti in temples? Zero.  How many times have you woken up at 4:30 in morning because of noise from Azan in mosques? 365 times in a year (if you live within 5 km radius of a mosque).  Zero vs 365 settles everything.  Even if Aarti loudspeaker in your locality starts at 4:30 in full volume, you can simply go to the priest and he will reduce it. Just try doing it with a Moulvi in a mosque and see if you come back in single piece.  Pigeral : Huh, and what about your Ganesh Yatra, Hanuman Yatra? Don't they make noise? Stop them.  Agniveer : How many times in a year do Ganesh Chaturthi and Hanuman Jayanti come?  Pigeral : At least 10 days.  Agniveer : And how many times does Azan happen on loudspeaker in a year?  Pigeral :  Agniveer : Why silent? Let me help you. 365*5 = 1825. And then in addition, there are rallies, bike stunts, processions etc on Prophet's B'Day, Eid and Muharram etc.  So it is 10 vs 1825+. Are 10 and 1825 same?  Pigeral : Wrong is wrong. There is no bigger or smaller wrong.  Agniveer : Ok then, your 34/36/38 waist size is also wrong. Come to shape before commenting on our concerns on Azan.  Pigeral : How can you compare my personal fitness issue with an issue of 20% minorities?  Agniveer : Same way as you compared 10 with 1825+.  Pigeral :  Agniveer : Why silent?  Pigeral : Look, you can't interfere in others' religion. India is multicultural society. Every religion has equal rights.  Agniveer : Equal rights? Do we have equal rights? A Muslim can marry 4 women at a time and divorce them at will. A Hindu is jailed for doing same. Where are equal rights? And where are equal rights for Muslim women? You just need equal rights of noise. And you don't care about plight of 10 crore Muslim women?  Look, equal rights come with equal responsibilities. You follow equal laws, you will get equal rights. You act as some special hero, your a$$ will be kicked.  And finally, there is another solid difference. There is strong correlation between density of Azan and terror. Find out the places on earth where  1. Azan is maximum (lets call it Place 1) 2. Aarti is maximum (lets call it Place 2)  Then find out how many world's top terrorists/terror organisations do Place 1 group and Place 2 group produce.  That is the ultimate litmus test on which noise is dangerous and which is harmless.  Pigeral :  Agniveer : Why silent?  Pigeral : Who are you man?  Agniveer : A proud Hindu. A proud idol worshipper. A proud Jihadi-hater. A proud Indian. Agniveer is the name.   ~ Vashi Sharma Agniveer Copied",0,1

You need them or else you would lose funding from the natural gas lobby.  Trump: Stop funding Pakistan. Let India deal with them.  CIA: We can't do that.  Trump: Why is that?  CIA: India will cut Balochistan out of Pak.  Trump: I don't care.  CIA: India will have peace in Kashmir. They will stop buying our weapons. They will become a superpower. We have to fund Pakistan to keep India busy in Kashmir.  Trump: But you have to destroy the Taliban.  CIA: Sir, we can't do that. We created the Taliban to keep Russia in check during the 80s. Now they are keeping Pakistan busy and away from their nukes.  Trump: We have to destroy terror sponsoring regimes in the Middle East. Let us start with the Saudis.  Pentagon: Sir, we can't do that. We created those regimes because we wanted their oil. We can't have democracy there, otherwise their people will get that oil - and we cannot let their people own it.  Trump: Then, let us invade Iran.  Pentagon: We cannot do that either, sir.  Trump: Why not?  CIA: We are talking to them, sir.  Trump: What? Why?  CIA: We want our Stealth Drones back. If we attack them, Russia will obliterate us as they did to our buddy ISIS in Syria. Besides we need Iran to keep Israel in check.  Trump: Then let us invade Iraq again.  CIA: Sir, our friends (ISIS) are already occupying 1/3rd of Iraq.  Trump: Why not the whole of Iraq?  CIA: We need the Shi'ite govt of Iraq to keep ISIS in check.  Trump: I am banning Muslims from entering US.  FBI: We can't do that.  Trump: Why not?  FBI: Then our own population will become fearless.  Trump: I am deporting all illegal immigrants to south of the border.  Border patrol: You can't do that, sir.  Trump: Why not?  Border patrol: If they're gone, who will build the wall?  Trump: I am banning H1B visas.  USCIS: You cannot do that.  Trump: Why?  Chief of Staff: If you do so, we'll have to outsource White House operations to Bangalore. Which is in India.

hasoc_english_321112,"Kevin Gaskin.  You're most welcome to search the Bill of Rights, the U.S. Constitution and the Declaration of Independence but you'll not find anything about "separation of Church and State" contained in any of them.  Thomas Jefferson wrote a letter to the Danbury Baptist Association in 1802 to answer a letter from them, asking why he would not proclaim national days of fasting and thanksgiving, as had been done by Washington and Adams before him. The letter contains the phrase "wall of separation between church and state," which led to the erroneous ‚Äòshort-hand‚Äô for the Establishment Clause (U.S. Constitution, Bill of Rights, Amendment I, Article III) that we use today.      ‚ÄúWhy do I have a freedom of religion‚Ä¶?‚Äù  The answer lay in the Congressional papers as they pertain to our Constitution as we know it today.  The process of drafting the First Amendment made the intent of the Founders abundantly clear; for before they approved the final wording, the First Amendment went through nearly a dozen different iterations and extensive discussions.   ‚ÄúWe do not want in America what we had in Great Britain: we don‚Äôt want one denomination running the Nation.  We will not all be Catholics, or Anglicans, or any other single denomination.  We do want God‚Äôs principles, but we don‚Äôt want one denomination running the Nation.‚Äù  This intent was well understood, as evidence by court rulings after the First Amendment.  In 1799 the court declared, ‚ÄúBy our form of government, the Christian religion is the established religion; and all sects and denominations of Christians are placed on the same equal footing.‚Äù   One must realize that our Founding Fathers were striving to attain ‚Äúfreedom of religion‚Äù due to the oppressive authority of the Roman Catholic Church.  It wasn‚Äôt only Britain but most of Europe that fell under the awesome authority of Roman Catholicism.  Our Founding Fathers set about to recognize the many denominations of Christianity.  Further, they intended to recognize each denomination equally, as opposed to granting power of control by any one denomination.  Herein lay the misinterpretation of the reckless ‚Äòshorthand‚Äô known as ‚Äúseparation of Church and State.‚Äù    A more accurate statement is likely ‚Äúseparation of denominations of the Church and State.‚Äù  Such interpretation is wholly supported by the Congressional papers in reference to the statement, ‚ÄúWe do not want in America what we had in Great Britain: we don‚Äôt want one denomination running the Nation.  We will not all be Catholics, or Anglicans, or any other single denomination.  We do want God‚Äôs principles, but we don‚Äôt want one denomination running the Nation.‚Äù  As for the statement, ‚ÄúMost of our founding fathers were agnostic,‚Äù that is simply not true.  It is a blanket statement proclaimed by those who oppose religion in general.  Yes, there were agnostics in those days but they were not nearly so prevalent as claimed.  Thomas Paine was an English-American political activist, philosopher, political theorist, and revolutionary.  Although he is considered one of our Founding Fathers, he was shunned for his known agnostic beliefs.  John Adams is another erroneously accused of being agnostic.  Yet, here is a quote from President Adams in reference to Thomas Paine; "The Christian religion is, above all the religions that ever prevailed or existed in ancient or modern times, the religion of wisdom, virtue, equity and humanity, let the Blackguard Paine say what he will.‚Äù  I believe you‚Äôll agree his words regarding Mr. Paine are more than sufficient to dispel any claims of his agnostic beliefs.",1,0

hasoc_english_321346,"Q1) Are GDP data fudged?  - Yes, they are. They aren't accurate. They are being fudged to promote a lie.  Q2) Can you prove that the GDP data are fudged?  - Until January'2015, Indian economy was witnessing its worth growth since the mid 1980s. And then the magic happened. The Central Statistical Office (CSO) changed the way it calculates GDP saying that it was necessary to do so keeping in view the global practices. As a result, India outpaced China and became the fastest growing economy. In 2013-14 our economy grew at 6.9%, rather than 4.7%, which the CSO data showed earlier. Even the country's chief economic advisor, Arvind Subramanian, said ‚ÄúI am puzzled by the new GDP growth numbers. The revised numbers show GDP growth rose from 4.7% to 5.1% for 2012-13 and from 5% to 6.9% for 2013-14. This means acceleration in GDP growth of 1.9 percentage points in 2013-14, just by comparing the new numbers across time". He also said "these numbers, especially the acceleration in 2013-14, are at odds with other features of the macro economy". Almost every economic expert, working in or out of the government ( including Mr Raghuram Rajan), questioned the GDP numbers as they found that the ground realities reflected a completely opposite picture. The new GDP numbers seemed completely in conflict with other economic indicators. According to R Nagraj , an independent member of the sub-committee that examined the new methodology to estimate output, the version adopted by the Central Stastical Organisation differed dramatically from the report finalised by the sub-committee in September 2014.  Q3) What about the latest GDP data released post-demonetization?  - They too are fudged. While the performance of few sectors have been better when compared to their performance in previous quarters, the huge improvement in private consumption (almost doubled) seems highly doubtful amidst the cash crunch during demonetization. It seems that the CSO hasn't been able to map the demonetization effect in its data. Both the government and RBI have also been saying ( just like few of their sensible critics) that the effect of demonetization can be mapped over a longer time-frame. Also, the CSO revised DOWN the Q3 estimates of 2015-16 by 0.3 percentage point to 6.9% from 7.2% earlier, which led to considerable improvement in Q3 2016-17 figures. For those who don't find it surprising, the CSO revised UP Q1 and Q2 estimates of 2015-16. This downward revision of Q3 of 2015-16 has helped in restricting the effect of demonetization in figures.  Q4) I am not able to understand anything. Why?  - You won't be able to get it. You are neither a statistician nor an economist. Everytime reports and claims like these surface, hustle a little bit on internet beyond Facebook and Twitter, and read about basic things and what experts have to say about them.  Q5) But Modi ji says experts know nothing. Don't you think that he is right?  - After Hindutva, the best tactic Modi ji has got is misinformation.

Erdoƒüan inherited a debt of $23.5 billion to the IMF, which was reduced to $0.9 billion in 2012. He decided not to sign a new deal. Turkey's debt to the IMF was thus declared to be completely paid and he announced that the IMF could borrow from Turkey.  In 2010, five-year credit default swaps for Turkey's sovereign debt were trading at a record low of 1.17%, below those of nine EU member countries and Russia.  In 2002, the Turkish Central Bank had $26.5 billion in reserves. This amount reached $92.2 billion in 2011. During Erdoƒüan's leadership. Inflation fell from 32% to 9.0% in 2004.  Under Erdoƒüan's government, the number of airports in Turkey increased from 26 to 50.  Between 2002 and 2011, another 13500 km of expressway were built.  For the first time in Turkish history, high speed railway lines were constructed, and the country's high-speed train service began in 2009. In 8 years, 1076 km of railway were built and 5449 km of railway renewed.  Erdogan put greater investments into the healthcare system than any predecessor. As part of the reforms, the "Green Card" program, which provides free health benefits to the poor.  Erdoƒüan increased Education spending from 7.5 billion lira in 2002 to 34 billion lira in 2011, the highest share of the national budget given to one ministry and number of universities in Turkey nearly doubled, from 98 in 2002 to 186 in October 2012.

Come out with positive approach and introduce incentives to IT return filers ( learn from Pakistan, IT assessee gets discount in purchase of Car )  3.

Polygamy was practiced by most of the Hindu males, especially Brahmins, like Tiwaris, Dubeys, Choubeys etc. ... With religion by their side, some of them used to marry more than 100 Hindu-women, even at the death-bed (infamous Antarjali Yatra) ... After the death of old husbands, the just-married baby-girls used to be made 'SATI' by throwing her on the pyre of her husband ...  A bengali film named 'Antarjali Jatra', under the direction of famous director Goutam Ghose was released in 1987.

It was very sad to see that your journalists don't even know the difference between fatwa and appeal.   A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa).

hasoc_english_323142,"How to convert all your black money into white in 4 easy perfectly "legal" steps?  Answer:-  -> Step 1 - Create a political party, and get registered under Representation of People's Act, 1951. [Not a difficult task. There are more than 1000 registered parties who didn't even contest 2014 Lok Sabha Election, and EC cannot de-register a party]  -> Step 2 - Donate all your black money to your party in parts, each part should be less than 20,000. You can make infinite such donations, and say that they came from people.  [According to the RP Act 1951, the political parties are not required to report (to the Election Commission of India (ECI)) the name of the individuals or organizations from whom they have received donations of amount less than Rs.20,000.]  -> Step 3 - Go to bank, deposit all this amount in the party's account.  [No need to pay any income tax. Political parties are 100% exempted from income tax]  -> Step 4 - Withdraw the amount as and when you need, in 50/100/500/2000 rupee notes - It is all white.  [Since Political Parties are not under RTI, you can't ask them how they spent their money]  ENJOY YOUR WEALTH...!!!!  *Moral of the Story:- All political parties are same. All they do is follow the letter of law like above example & kill the spirit which is politically correct but ethically incorrect.

So the argument of nepotism is weak in my view.   b) What you also need to understand. Karan runs a production house and the nature of work/hierarchy is very different than that of the usual corporates.   c) Karan invests money into a film and as the creative head of his company, he has every right to cast whosoever he feels fits the bill and can contribute to the success of his film/attract audience. And like someone rightly pointed out, it is talent that will sustain at the end and if his choice of cast fails to impress the audience, it is his loss and as a businessman in the movies, he is smart enough to understand that dynamic.  d) Lastly, he has never shied away from praising the outsiders' work. In fact he also has no qualms in admitting that he is incapable of making certain kind of films that he thinks are brilliant and made by outsiders. His friendship with Anurag Kashyap is very strong and Kashyap has admitted how wrong a perception he had had about him just like many others until he came to know him.",1,0

A substantial population of Delhi re-elected this stupid moron because of multiple factors (back-to-back BJP victories and too much of Hindutva, including gharwapsi, were some of the contributing factors) and not the charismatic persona of this hypocrite, if somehow you perceived it that way. His spit-and-run strategy also shows how politically immature this person is. Trust me, this guy never wanted to do anything, he merely wanted to be praised and idolized. But for what? At least, Modi has got a product to sell along with a proven track-record. What has Kejriwal got except his persistent allegations (and quite ironically, when he cannot even face the same against him and his party)?    Yes, it might be true he is quite daring. But he is as daring as Rakhi Sawant, both of whom come up with new theatrics and drama to keep the general public laughing. If you believe he retweeted it because it was more logical, please do explain how logical was it to oust Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan. He did it merely because he had no other option. If Vishwas quits, Kejriwal, along with Aam Aadmi Party, would probably die, decay, and sink into the bottomless chasm of politics which has seen many parties share a similar fate.

A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices.

All schemes of 100000 lakh crores are declared in each budget but poorly implemented through central agencies constituted by unprofessional, political, official, and middlemen nexus, who always fancy of corruption than the success of these schemes. Second our corporate groups, who wants concession of reduced corporate tax and excise/custom duty only without competition at par world standards.

Shame on him. He is doing nothing except making fool to our innocent countrymen. Now lemme prove my points. When Modi would campaign for his party BJP (bhartiye jumla party) in 2014 general election, he promised that he would solve the case of Naxalites/ Maoists. He promised that he would solve Kashmir issue and abrogate article 370. He promised that he would solve the problem of OROP for army men. He promised to rebut Pakistan in the harshest way possible. He promised to give we youngsters a job/a secured career. He promised to protect every woman from monsters. He promised to eliminate corruption. He promised to make India great again..He promised to bring LokPal...He promised to bring back black money from Swiss bank... But it's irony that he has done just opposite to what he had promised a couple of years ago. He has not fulfilled even a single promise that he made to us...I was also one of those who were die hard fan of Mr. Modi but today when I see the condition of our country, I feel jittery...I think he has cheated all of us... Our Jawans are being killed by bloody Naxals/Maoists or by incorrigible Pakistan..We youths are being deprived of jobs by scrapping many government posts and minimizing vacancy..This government is absolutely anti-government jobs...Farmers are committing suicide everyday...Women are being tortured openly...Nagaland and Kashmir are demanding freedom and shouting anti-India slogans in our national capital's JNU...China is making CPEC through Gilgit Baltistan without even caring for our concern.. I am asking u after all what do we have got by electing Mr. Modi ? Are we not cheated?? Still we all are happy and voting for Modi just because a few members of BJP are speaking against muslims and in support of Ram Mandir...Are we not fools?? Hating muslims is the only eligibility that forces us to support BJP??

Erdoƒüan inherited a debt of $23.5 billion to the IMF, which was reduced to $0.9 billion in 2012. He decided not to sign a new deal. Turkey's debt to the IMF was thus declared to be completely paid and he announced that the IMF could borrow from Turkey.    In 2010, five-year credit default swaps for Turkey's sovereign debt were trading at a record low of 1.17%, below those of nine EU member countries and Russia.    In 2002, the Turkish Central Bank had $26.5 billion in reserves. This amount reached $92.2 billion in 2011. During Erdoƒüan's leadership. Inflation fell from 32% to 9.0% in 2004.    Under Erdoƒüan's government, the number of airports in Turkey increased from 26 to 50.    Between 2002 and 2011, another 13500 km of expressway were built.    For the first time in Turkish history, high speed railway lines were constructed, and the country's high-speed train service began in 2009. In 8 years, 1076 km of railway were built and 5449 km of railway renewed.    Erdogan put greater investments into the healthcare system than any predecessor. As part of the reforms, the "Green Card" program, which provides free health benefits to the poor.    Erdoƒüan increased Education spending from 7.5 billion lira in 2002 to 34 billion lira in 2011, the highest share of the national budget given to one ministry and number of universities in Turkey nearly doubled, from 98 in 2002 to 186 in October 2012.

It was very sad to see that your journalists don't even know the difference between fatwa and appeal.   A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices.

All tax experts are hailing the judgement as, gr8 transperent and strong legal system. This judgenent will encourage more FDI . Blah blah blah.    I fail to understand, all that is fine, "to uphold the agreement". However such protection is not available to all sundry.    When we, retail investers purchase shares at the then prevailing market price, why we are not allowed to incorporate such clause, "should the market price fall 50% of it, Company should give us back at least 50% of the price at which we had purchased the share in market."     That time the clause is , "Investment in market is subject to risk, you may loose your money completely, kindly take advice from experts before investing."    To understand more clearly a retail invester's agony, lets take an example. Many must have invested in IPOs at a premium , in "Co A", believing  tall claims made by promoters. They invested in Rs.10 face valyed share at say Rs225.00 in say 2009 same time when Docomo invested in Tata Tele Services.    Sadly today the said " Co A" share market price falls to Rs3.00.    Now can any one of these investers, such aggrived retail invrster approch the company to pay atleast Rs112.50 ( 50% of stake price invested). Just like DoCoMo approaching Tata Sons, to repurchase their shares at 50% of stake price.    I know, tax experts (hailing the Delhi HC judgement ) will say, where is the agreement between the company and retail investers?    Thats exactly, where the shoe pinches. All our system, laws tries to protect interests of super HNIs only.    If Delhi HC feels such clause of protecting 50% of stakeholders price is fair, should not The Govt too amended suitably the existing Company Law, in oder to protect retail investers stakes in comoany.? There pl don't insist on defence, our clause clearly states, your investnents are subject to market risks, may loose your money in entireity.    Will RBI go ahead to appeal in SC? Will our Govt force the pramoters to safeguard the retail investers investments? Well may not be at 50% of their market priced investment, but on some clearly defined prorata basis.",1,0

In Ola and Uber , the old investors were drivers and owners who put in their own cars with assurance from Ola and Uber of business per day of at least rs 3000 per day .   Photo no 1 proof . Misleading advertisements.     2) once the car owner investors got human resource and trained their drivers and took responsibility of accidents, Ola management introduced their own fleet. ( mainly Maruti swift Desire, Sx 4 &  Datsun cars ) They also poached drivers of investor cars promising them ownership of company cars if they drove currently at a low wage as low as 3-4000 per month. To penalise drivers of investor cars , Ola started giving false bookings to drivers and levies penalty if drivers cancelled those . Deliberate false calls and waiting for client , if cancelled by driver - penalty !   Proof photo no 2     Fraud business showed navigation of client pick up through Arabian sea , proving navigational errors in the software of Ola & Uber .     Proof photo no 3   Penalty was levied on drivers for not taking those calls.     All complaints made at Andheri Police station but no FIR/ NC made . Senior PI hand in glove with Ola officials . False cases registered against drivers for  violence during peaceful demonstration. video of senior PI Andheri East police station, apologising to Taxi drivers sanghatana for false cases being told to do so by seniors and Ola officials , available on what  App and to the media . Statements of taxi Union leaders were taken yesterday .     Here the old investors are duped and new investors seem to be the government with probable tie ups with companies like Swift for desire models , Sx4 Datsun . Japanese collaboration.     Tip : SX4  Desires have serious blind spot problems . Incoming traffic from right side is not visualised properly due to narrow windscreen and small window size . The GPRS systems employed by cabs on mobiles are stuck on same side as the blind spot mirror , making it more difficult to visualise incoming traffic. The models were hence discontinued . If those are passed on for public transport , it would be a serious public safety issue .",1,0

THE GRASS IS ALWAYS GREENER‚Ä¶     While troopers of PMFs, CPOs, CAPFs seek parity with the Armed Forces in service benefits,     can they answer following questions:  [Officers form less than 3% of 12.6 Lakh strong Army yet their casualties rate is 11.5%. Is it foolish fatal attraction with death? No way sir, he does it because of what is ingrained in him: My own Safety & Welfare comes Last, Always & Every time. That he would let harm come to his men, 'paltan's izzat' or to innocent citizen, only over his dead body].    Q1. Has he served along with Army anywhere ?    Q2. Had he gone to Siachin ever ?    Q3. Is he aware what's the retirement age of jawaan in army ?    Q4. Had he ever compared availability of married accommodation to army with that of PMF ?    Q5. Is he aware that Army is yet to get 7th CPC?    Q6. Is he aware in the entire service , for how much duration Army personnel keep their families along with them and ever compared with the duration of PMF personnels ?    Q7. He talks about casual leave of army but is he aware that out of that leave how much is availed ?    Q8. Is he aware that army is doing additional task of maintaining internal peace in which they have failed the nation?    Q9. Is he aware about the illness rate in army and the diseases which are common to army personnel? Ever tried to compare the death rate of the Army with other forces?    Q10. Is he aware that his departmental officers come under a specific group of service and in places like Guwahati will get more then double the allowance what army officers will get in Siachin Glacier? If that's the difference among the officer cadre then how come Army jawaan can be better?    Q11. Had he ever seen his assistant commandants walking through out with his troops during Road Opening Patrol ?    Q12. Had he ever compared the casualty rate between the two forces?    Q13. Was he stopped by someone from joining the Army ?    Q14. Most of the Army jawaans retire by 40yrs of age whereas PMF personnel's serves 15 to 20 years more. If he adds the total pay received by him in serving this additional tenure, he will find himself getting almost thrice in comparison to the army personnel's.    Q 15. Does any of his officers lead from the front to take the hail of the first bullets with the troops following behind?    Q16. Is he not aware that most of the PMF jawaans become equivalent to a JCO whereas in army it is not even 10% ?    There are several other questions too....But here aim is not to raise questions against any organization. Everyone is doing his job, everyone has own problems.

They are emotionally unbalanced. They feel that they are victimized and they are angry at the world. Islam is a perfect religion for them. It validates their sense of victimization and provides then a definable enemy to hate. The new converts to Islam find a sense of direction in their lives that they never had before. However that is not the direction towards love, inner peace and enlightenment. In Islam they find a venue to express their anger, this time with no bang of conscience but with conviction, determination and a sense of purpose.  Political correctness is a major defect of the western ethos. Some Western countries have even passed blasphemy laws that would put you in legal hot waters if you say anything negative about Islam. This means that the truth about Islam cannot be said but Muslims are given total freedom to spread their religion with lies. Islam thrives were truth is suppressed. That is one reason that westerners convert to Islam. They are lied to. How do you expect a society to survive when truth is banned and lies are allowed? In west lack of political correctness, moral declination and innocency towards Islam and Islamic People in westerns are some of the reasons. In Muslim controlled countries, cunning Islamic laws and high birth rate are main reasons. In East love jihad, vigorous advertising of islam by degrading other religions,  fear blackmailing and Excessive highly birth rate of muslims infants are major reasons for muslim's high population growth rate. So where is the merit of islam in conversions?  Merit of islam in conversions is to provide all pseudo reasons for further immoral actions by new Muslims.",0,1
